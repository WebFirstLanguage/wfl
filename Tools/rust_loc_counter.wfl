// Rust Line Counter - WFL Implementation
// Analyzes Rust source files and generates line count statistics
// 
// This is a WebFirst Language implementation of the rust_loc_counter.py tool
// It recursively scans .rs files and provides estimates of:
// - Total lines
// - Code lines  
// - Comment lines
// - Blank lines
//
// Usage: wfl rust_loc_counter.wfl [directory]
// Default directory: ./src

// Main action to run the line counter on test files
