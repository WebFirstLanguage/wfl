// Test chained binary operations bug
store a as 5
store b as 10 
store c as 15

// This should be 30 (5 + 10 + 15) but currently returns only 15
store result as a plus b plus c
display result

// String concatenation test  
store x as "hello"
store y as " "
store z as "world"

// This should be "hello world" but currently returns only "world"
store greeting as x plus y plus z
display greeting

// More complex test with mixed operations
store num1 as 2
store num2 as 3
store num3 as 4

// Should be 14 (2 * 3 + 4 + 2) but likely returns wrong value
store complex as num1 times num2 plus num3 plus num1
display complex
