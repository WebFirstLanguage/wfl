# WFL Implementation Progress - 2025-04-17

## Lexer Implementation

- Implemented the WFL lexer using the Logos crate
- Defined token types for all WFL language constructs:
  - Reserved keywords (store, create, display, if, check, etc.)
  - Literals (boolean, nothing, string, integer, float)
  - Identifiers (including multi-word identifiers)
- Implemented handling for multi-word identifiers by merging consecutive identifier tokens
- Added position tracking for tokens (line, column, length)
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the lexer:
  - Multi-word identifiers
  - Literals and comments
  - Hello world program
  - Conditional statements
  - Loop statements

The lexer now successfully tokenizes WFL source code according to the language specification, handling:
- Whitespace and comment skipping
- Reserved keyword recognition
- String literals with escape sequences
- Numeric literals (integer and float)
- Boolean literals (yes/no/true/false)
- Nothing literals (nothing/missing/undefined)
- Multi-word identifiers

## Parser Implementation

- Defined AST data structures for WFL language constructs:
  - Program structure
  - Statements (variable declarations, assignments, conditionals, loops, function definitions, etc.)
  - Expressions (literals, variables, binary operations, function calls, etc.)
  - Types and parameters
- Implemented a recursive descent parser that converts tokens into an AST
- Added error handling for syntax errors with line and column information
- Implemented parsers for:
  - Variable declarations
  - Display statements
  - If statements (both block form and single-line form)
  - Loops (count loops and for-each loops)
  - Function definitions
  - Expressions (literals, variables, binary operations)
  - Assignment statements
  - Return statements
  - File operations
- Created tests for the parser

Next steps:
- Implement the bytecode compiler to convert the AST into bytecode

## Semantic Analysis Implementation

- Implemented a symbol table with nested scopes
- Added semantic analysis for variable declarations and usage
- Added semantic analysis for function definitions and calls
- Implemented error reporting for undefined variables, wrong argument counts, etc.
- Created tests for the semantic analyzer
- Added built-in symbols like 'yes', 'no', 'nothing' to global scope
- Updated AST nodes to include location information for better error reporting
