Of course. Based on the provided design and implementation documents, here is a phased to-do list for implementing the new WFL pattern matching system. This approach breaks the project into manageable stages, starting with foundational work and progressively adding more complex features.

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Basic Parsing

**Goal:** Establish the foundational syntax for patterns in the WFL compiler. At the end of this phase, the language will be able to parse and understand simple pattern definitions, though it won't be able to execute them yet.

* **Extend the Lexer:**
    * [ ] Add new keywords to `src/lexer/token.rs` required for pattern matching. This includes:
        * **Keywords:** `pattern`, `matches`, `capture`, `then`.
        * **Quantifiers:** `zero or more`, `one or more`, `optional`, `exactly`, `between`.
        * **Character Classes:** `any letter`, `any digit`, `any whitespace`.
        * **Anchors:** `start of`, `end of`.

* **Extend the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):**
    * [ ] Define new AST nodes in `src/parser/ast.rs` to represent pattern logic.
        * Create a `Pattern` enum to represent different pattern structures (e.g., `Literal`, `CharacterClass`, `Quantified`, `Sequence`).
        * Create a `PatternDefinition` statement for named patterns (`define pattern email as ...`).
        * Create a `MatchStatement` to handle `check if ... matches pattern ...`.

* **Implement the Parser:**
    * [ ] Update the parser in `src/parser/mod.rs` to recognize the new tokens and build the corresponding AST nodes.
    * [ ] Implement parsing for simple literal patterns (e.g., `then "hello"`).
    * [ ] Implement parsing for basic character classes (e.g., `any letter`, `any digit`).
    * [ ] Implement parsing for basic quantifiers (`one or more`, `optional`).

* **Create Initial Tests:**
    * [ ] Write unit tests to verify that the parser correctly builds the AST for simple literal, character class, and quantified patterns.

### Phase 2: Pattern Compiler and Basic Matching Engine

**Goal:** Translate the parsed pattern AST into an efficient, executable format and implement a basic matching engine that can handle simple sequences and character classes.

* **Design the Intermediate Representation (IR):**
    * [ ] Define a "bytecode" or instruction set for the pattern VM. This `Instruction` enum will include operations like `Char`, `CharClass`, `Jump`, and `Match`.

* **Build the Pattern Compiler:**
    * [ ] Create a compiler that traverses the pattern AST and generates the corresponding IR/bytecode.
    * [ ] Implement compilation for literals, character classes, sequences (`then`), and alternations (`or`).
    * [ ] Implement compilation for basic quantifiers by expanding them into simpler instructions (e.g., jumps and splits for NFA simulation).

* **Implement the Matching Engine:**
    * [ ] Build a simple NFA-based virtual machine that executes the generated bytecode against input text.
    * [ ] The engine should support basic matching for the features compiled in the previous step.

* **Testing and Benchmarking:**
    * [ ] Write unit tests for the compiler to ensure correct IR generation for various patterns.
    * [ ] Write integration tests for the matcher to verify that it correctly matches or fails strings based on simple patterns.
    * [ ] Establish initial performance benchmarks to measure matching speed.

### Phase 3: Advanced Feature Implementation

**Goal:** Enhance the pattern engine to support advanced features common in modern regex, such as capture groups and lookarounds, bringing it closer to PCRE compatibility.

* **Implement Capture Groups:**
    * [ ] Add support for named captures (`capture one or more letters as "name"`) to the parser, compiler, and matcher.
    * [ ] Implement the backreference feature (`same as captured "word"`).
    * [ ] Create an API or runtime mechanism to extract captured values from a successful match.

* **Implement Lookarounds:**
    * [ ] Add syntax and compilation logic for positive and negative lookaheads (`followed by "px"`, `not followed by "px"`).
    * [ ] Add syntax and compilation logic for positive and negative lookbehinds (`preceded by "$"` a`nd not preceded by "$"`).

* **Add Full Unicode Support:**
    * [ ] Enhance character classes to support Unicode properties (e.g., `any character in "Greek"`).
    * [ ] Ensure the matching engine correctly handles Unicode characters and boundaries.

* **Create Advanced Tests:**
    * [ ] Write integration tests for capture groups, backreferences, and all lookaround features.

### Phase 4: Full Runtime Integration and Standard Library

**Goal:** Make the pattern matching system a first-class citizen in the WFL language, accessible and easy to use for developers through built-in actions and a standard library.

* **Integrate with WFL's Type System:**
    * [ ] Introduce a `Value::Pattern` type to represent compiled patterns in the runtime.
    * [ ] Introduce a `Value::MatchResult` type to hold the results of a match, including captures.

* **Implement Built-in Actions:**
    * [ ] Create the user-facing actions for pattern matching:
        * `matches`: `check if "text" matches pattern "..."`.
        * `find`: `find pattern "..." in "text"`.
        * `find all`: `find all pattern "..." in "text"`.
        * `replace`: `replace pattern "..." with "..." in "text"`.
        * `split`: `split "text" by pattern "..."`.

* **Build the Standard Pattern Library:**
    * [ ] Implement a library of common, pre-defined patterns that are available globally. This should include:
        * `email`, `url`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `phone`, `credit card`, `iso date`, `uuid`.

* **Write Documentation:**
    * [ ] Create a user guide and cookbook with examples on how to use the new pattern matching system.
    * [ ] Document all built-in actions and standard library patterns.

### Phase 5: Optimization, Error Handling, and Final Polish

**Goal:** Ensure the pattern matching system is performant, robust, and provides a user-friendly experience, especially when errors occur.

* **Implement Performance Optimizations:**
    * [ ] Create a caching system for compiled patterns to prevent redundant compilation of the same pattern string.
    * [ ] (Future) Investigate JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation for "hot" patterns that are used frequently in a program.

* **Improve Error Handling and Diagnostics:**
    * [ ] Implement compile-time validation to provide clear error messages for invalid pattern syntax (e.g., `one or more of (...)` with a missing closing parenthesis).
    * [ ] Add runtime guards to detect and prevent catastrophic backtracking, protecting against ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    * [ ] Design and implement a pattern debugger to help users troubleshoot complex patterns.

* **Provide a Migration Path:**
    * [ ] (Optional) Implement a PCRE compatibility mode or a conversion tool that translates traditional regex into WFL's natural language pattern syntax to ease migration for experienced developers.
    * [ ] Write a migration guide explaining how to convert from PCRE to WFL patterns.

* **Final Benchmarking and Testing:**
    * [ ] Run final performance benchmarks to ensure the engine meets its performance goals (e.g., within 2x of PCRE).
    * [ ] Conduct fuzz testing to find edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities.
