# WFL Keystore System - Phased Development Plan

*A comprehensive TDD-based implementation plan for the WFL Keystore system based on the KV Bucket Store specification.*

**Status**: Draft  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Target**: WFL v25.9+  

---

## Overview

This document outlines a phased development approach for implementing the WFL Keystore system based on the [KV Bucket Store specification](kv_bucket_store_single_file_key_value_datastore_spec_v_0.md). The implementation follows WFL's core principles:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Every phase starts with failing tests
- **Natural Language Syntax** - Intuitive, English-like commands
- **Backward Compatibility** - All existing functionality continues to work
- **Incremental Development** - Each phase builds upon the previous

## Development Principles

### TDD Methodology (MANDATORY)
1. **Write failing tests FIRST** for each feature in TestPrograms/
2. **Confirm tests fail** before writing any implementation code
3. **Commit failing tests** as proof of requirements
4. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass
5. **Never modify tests** to make them pass - fix implementation instead
6. **All existing TestPrograms must continue to pass** after each phase

### Natural Language Syntax Design

The keystore system will support intuitive WFL syntax:

```wfl
// Keystore lifecycle
create keystore at "data.kvb" as store
open keystore at "data.kvb" as store
close keystore store

// Basic operations
store "Hello World" in store with key "greeting"
store "Temporary data" in store with key "temp" for 3600 seconds
get value from store with key "greeting" as result
check if store contains key "greeting"
remove key "greeting" from store

// Advanced operations
scan store for keys starting with "user:" as results
compact store
get statistics from store as stats
```

## Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Operations (2-3 weeks)

### Objective
Establish the keystore foundation with basic CRUD operations and natural language syntax integration.

### TDD Test Requirements
**File**: `TestPrograms/keystore_basic_operations.wfl`

**Must include failing tests for**:
- Keystore creation with natural language syntax
- Basic PUT operation with verification
- GET operation with existing and non-existing keys  
- DELETE operation with verification
- Keystore closing and reopening
- Error handling for invalid operations
- Backward compatibility with existing datastore functions

### Implementation Deliverables
- [ ] **TestPrograms/keystore_basic_operations.wfl** - Comprehensive failing tests
- [ ] **src/stdlib/keystore.rs** - Basic keystore implementation
- [ ] **Natural language syntax support** - Parser updates if needed
- [ ] **Registration in src/stdlib/mod.rs** - Module integration
