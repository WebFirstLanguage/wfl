# Implementation Progress - May 20, 2025

## Lexer Position Calculation Fix

- Fixed issue with token column position reporting in the lexer output
- The lexer was incorrectly using absolute file offsets as column positions instead of relative positions within each line
- This caused column numbers to be much larger than the actual line length for tokens later in the file
- Modified the `lex_wfl_with_positions` function in `src/lexer/mod.rs` to correctly calculate column positions relative to the current line
- Ensured column values represent positions within a line (starting from 1) rather than offsets from the start of the file

## Diagnostic CLI Flags Addition

- Added two new command-line flags to assist in debugging and development:
  - `--lex`: Dumps the lexer output into a text file and exits
  - `--ast`: Dumps the abstract syntax tree into a text file and exits
- Both flags can be used individually or together
- When either flag is used, the interpreter will not proceed with program execution
- Output files are created with the same name as the input file plus `.lex.txt` or `.ast.txt` extensions
- Added detailed formatting for both lexer and AST output to enhance readability

## Interpreter Debug Output Redirection

- Fixed issue where interpreter debug output was being displayed alongside program output
- Modified the `interpret` method in `src/interpreter/mod.rs` to route all debug information through the logging system
- Replaced `println!` statements with `exec_trace!` macros for debugging information
- Kept actual program output (from `DisplayStatement`) going to stdout
- This ensures a clean separation between program output and debugging information

## Analyzer Enhancement

- Fixed the static analyzer to properly detect variable usage in binary operations
- Previously, variables like `a` and `b` in expressions such as `a plus b` were incorrectly flagged as unused
- Modified the `check_unused_variables` function to process variable declarations in a first pass
- Ensured variables used in the right side of declarations are correctly marked as used
- Added explicit logic to analyze expression values in variable declarations
- Removed compiler warnings in the static analyzer code
- Verified the fix with simple test cases containing arithmetic operations

## Impact

This fix enables more accurate static analysis, particularly for:
- Arithmetic expressions (`plus`, `minus`, etc.)
- Conditional expressions
- Variable assignments

Example code that now works without false warnings:
```
store a as 6
store b as 2
store add_result as a plus b        // Previously a and b would be marked as unused
check if add_result is equal to 8:
    display "yes"
otherwise:
    display "no"
end check
```

## Technical Implementation

1. Enhanced the `check_unused_variables` function to use a two-pass approach:
   - First pass: Collect all declarations and mark variables used in variable declaration expressions
   - Second pass: Mark all used variables in other statements
   
2. Ensured the `mark_used_in_expression` function correctly traverses binary operations
   - Left side operand is marked as used
   - Right side operand is marked as used

3. Removed compiler warnings to maintain code quality

4. For the interpreter debug output:
   - Replaced 5 instances of `println!` with `exec_trace!` in the `interpret` method
   - Added comments to clarify the separation of debug output vs program output
   - Maintained all the same information in the logs for debugging purposes

5. For the new diagnostic flags:
   - Added `lex_dump` and `ast_dump` boolean flags to track when these options are used
   - Modified command-line argument parsing to recognize `--lex` and `--ast`
   - Added detailed formatting code for both outputs
   - Created helper function for writing to output files
   - Implemented proper error handling for file writing operations

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests specifically for variable usage analysis in binary operations
2. Consider expanding static analysis to detect other common issues:
   - Variables that are written but never read
   - Redundant variable assignments
3. Consider adding debug/trace level configuration to allow more granular control over logging verbosity
4. Consider enhancing the lexer and AST dumps:
   - Add optional JSON output format for programmatic processing
   - Add visualization options for the AST (e.g., tree view)
