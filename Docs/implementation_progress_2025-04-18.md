## Interpreter Implementation (Milestone 7)

The interpreter for WFL has been implemented with the following components:

- **Runtime Value Representation**: Implemented a `Value` enum that can represent all WFL types (Number, Text, Boolean, List, Object, Function, etc.)
- **Environment Management**: Created an `Environment` struct for variable scoping with parent-child relationships
- **Expression Evaluation**: Implemented evaluation for all expression types (literals, variables, binary/unary operations, function calls, etc.)
- **Statement Execution**: Implemented execution for all statement types (variable declarations, assignments, if statements, loops, function definitions, etc.)
- **Memory Management**: Used Rust's smart pointers (Rc, RefCell) to efficiently manage memory and avoid unnecessary copying
- **Error Handling**: Implemented a `RuntimeError` struct for reporting runtime errors with line and column information
- **Execution Time Limits**: Added maximum iteration limits for loops to prevent infinite loops

The interpreter can now execute WFL programs that don't involve asynchronous operations. Asynchronous support will be added in the next milestone.

### Known Issues

- There's a specific issue with how the interpreter handles the "count" keyword in expressions inside count loops. When using "count" directly in a display statement inside a count loop (e.g., `display "Count: " with count`), the interpreter may hang. A workaround is to store the count value in a separate variable and use that variable in expressions.

### Next Steps

- Fix the issue with the "count" keyword in expressions
- Implement full support for asynchronous operations using Tokio
- Add more built-in functions for I/O operations
- Implement proper break/continue handling for loops
- Add support for file operations
- Address compiler warnings
