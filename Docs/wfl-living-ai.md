## WFL Language Syntax Reference

### Core Principles
- **Natural Language Syntax**: Code reads like English sentences
- **Minimal Special Characters**: Uses words instead of symbols (`plus` instead of `+`)
- **Case Insensitive**: Keywords and identifiers are case-insensitive
- **Block Structure**: Uses `end` keywords to close blocks (no braces)

### Variable Declaration and Assignment

```wfl
// Variable declaration - use "store" or "create"
store user_name as "Alice"
store age as 28
store is_active as yes
store balance as 123.45
store nothing_value as nothing

// Variable assignment - use "change X to Y"
change age to 29
change user_name to "Bob"

// Arithmetic updates
add 10 to balance
subtract 5 from balance
multiply balance by 1.1
divide balance by 2
```

### Data Types

```wfl
// Text (strings)
store greeting as "Hello, World!"
store multiline as "Line 1
Line 2"

// Numbers (integers and floats)
store count as 42
store price as 19.99

// Booleans
store is_ready as yes    // or "true"
store is_done as no      // or "false"

// Lists
store numbers as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
store mixed as ["hello", 42, yes, nothing]
store empty_list as []

// Nothing (null/undefined)
store empty_value as nothing
```

### Control Flow

#### Conditional Statements
```wfl
// Basic if-then-else
check if age is greater than 18:
    display "Adult"
otherwise:
    display "Minor"
end check

// Multiple conditions
check if temperature is below 0:
    display "Freezing"
otherwise if temperature is below 20:
    display "Cold"
otherwise if temperature is below 30:
    display "Warm"
otherwise:
    display "Hot"
end check

// Logical operators
check if age is greater than 18 and is_active is yes:
    display "Eligible"
end check

check if name is "Alice" or name is "Bob":
    display "Recognized user"
end check
```

#### Loops
```wfl
// Count loop (for loop)
count from i as 1 to 10:
    display "Number: " with i
end count

// Count with step
count from i as 0 to 100 by 10:
    display i
end count

// For-each loop
store fruits as ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for each fruit in fruits:
    display "Fruit: " with fruit
end for

// While loop
store counter as 0
repeat while counter is less than 5:
    display "Counter: " with counter
    add 1 to counter
end repeat

// Until loop
repeat until counter is equal to 10:
    add 1 to counter
    display counter
end repeat

// Infinite loop with break
repeat forever:
    store input as read user input
    check if input is "quit":
        break
    end check
    display "You said: " with input
end repeat
```

### Functions (Actions)

```wfl
// Basic function definition
define action say_hello:
    display "Hello, World!"
end action

// Function with parameters
define action greet_user:
    needs:
        name as text
        age as number
    do:
        display "Hello, " with name with "! You are " with age with " years old."
end action

// Function with return value
define action calculate_area:
    needs:
        width as number
        height as number

        give back data
end action

// Calling functions
perform say_hello
perform greet_user with name as "Alice" and age as 25
store result as perform calculate_area with width as 10 and height as 5
```

end list

// List functions
store count as length of numbers
push of numbers and 4
store last as pop of numbers

store position as index_of of numbers and 3

// List iteration
for each item in items:
    display item
end for

// List access
store first as numbers[0]
store second as numbers[1]
```

### Error Handling

```wfl
// Basic try-catch
try:
    store result as 10 divided by 0
    display "Result: " with result
catch:
    display "An error occurred"
end try

// Specific error handling
try:
    open file at "data.txt" and read content as data
    display "File content: " with data
when file_error:
    display "Could not read file"
when permission_error:
    display "Permission denied"
otherwise:
    display "Unknown error occurred"
end try
```

### Async Operations

```wfl
// File operations
wait for open file at "config.txt" and read content as config
wait for open file at "output.txt" and write data

// HTTP requests
wait for open url at "https://api.example.com/data" and read content as response

// Web server
listen on port 8080 as server
wait for request comes in on server as request
respond to request with "Hello, World!" and content_type "text/plain"
```

## Code Patterns and Best Practices

### Variable Naming
```wfl
// Good: Descriptive names
store user_name as "Alice"
store total_price as 99.99
store is_authenticated as yes

// Avoid: Single letters or unclear names
store x as "Alice"        // Too short
store tp as 99.99         // Unclear
store flag as yes         // Generic
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```wfl
// Always handle potential errors
try:
    wait for open file at filename and read content as data
    // Process data
    display "Success: " with length of data with " characters read"
when file_error:
    display "Error: Could not read file " with filename
when permission_error:
    display "Error: Permission denied for " with filename
otherwise:
    display "Error: Unknown error reading " with filename
end try
```

### Async/Await Usage
```wfl
// Use 'wait for' for async operations
define async action process_urls:
    needs:
        urls as list
    do:
        for each url in urls:
            try:
                wait for open url at url and read content as response
                display "Fetched " with length of response with " bytes from " with url
            catch:
                display "Failed to fetch " with url
            end try
        end for
end action
```

### Function Design
```wfl
// Clear parameter and return types
define action calculate_discount:
    needs:
        original_price as number
        discount_percent as number
    gives back:
        final_price as number
    do:
        // Validate inputs
        check if original_price is less than 0:
            give back 0
        end check
        
        check if discount_percent is less than 0 or discount_percent is greater than 100:
            give back original_price
        end check
        
        // Calculate discount
        store discount_amount as original_price times discount_percent divided by 100
        store final_price as original_price minus discount_amount
        give back final_price
end action
```

### List Processing
```wfl
// Filter and transform lists
define action process_numbers:
    needs:
        numbers as list
    gives back:
        result as list
    do:
        store result as []
        
        for each num in numbers:
            // Filter: only positive numbers
            check if num is greater than 0:
                // Transform: square the number
                store squared as num times num
                push of result and squared
            end check
        end for
        
        give back result
end action
```

## AI-Specific Guidance

### Writing WFL Code
1. **Always use natural language constructs**: Prefer `store X as Y` over assignment operators
2. **Use descriptive variable names**: Multi-word names with spaces are allowed and encouraged
3. **Handle errors explicitly**: Use try/catch blocks for operations that might fail
4. **Follow TDD principles**: Write tests first, then implementation
5. **Use async/await properly**: Always use `wait for` with async operations

### Using WFL CLI Tools

#### Linting Code
```bash
# Check code style and potential issues
wfl --lint program.wfl

# Example output:
# Warning: Variable 'unused_var' is declared but never used
# Error: Missing 'end check' for conditional statement
```

#### Analyzing Code
```bash
# Perform static analysis
wfl --analyze program.wfl

# Example output:
# Info: Function 'calculate_total' has high complexity
# Warning: Potential null pointer access in line 45
```

#### Auto-fixing Code
```bash
# Show proposed fixes without applying
wfl --fix program.wfl --check

# Apply fixes in-place
wfl --fix program.wfl --in-place

# Show diff of proposed changes
wfl --fix program.wfl --diff
```

#### Debugging Code
```bash
# Run with debug output
wfl --debug program.wfl

# View tokens (lexer output)
wfl --lex program.wfl

# View AST (parser output)
wfl --parse program.wfl
```

### Interpreting Error Messages

WFL provides clear, actionable error messages:

#### Parse Errors
```
error: Expected 'as' after identifier(s), but found IntLiteral(42)
  --> example.wfl:3:14
   |
 3 | store greeting 42
   |              ^ Error occurred here
   |
   = Note: Did you forget to use 'as' before assigning a value? 
          For example: `store greeting as 42`
```

#### Type Errors
```
error: Cannot add number and text - Expected Number but found Text
  --> example.wfl:3:12
   |
 3 | display x plus y
   |            ^ Type error occurred here
   |
   = Note: Try converting the text to a number using 'convert to number'
```

#### Runtime Errors
```
error: Division by zero
  --> example.wfl:7:14
   |
 7 | display 10 divided by x
   |              ^ Runtime error occurred here
   |
   = Note: Check your divisor to ensure it's never zero
```

### TDD Best Practices

1. **Write failing tests first**:
```wfl
// test_calculator.wfl
define action test_addition:
    store result as perform add_numbers with a as 2 and b as 3
    check if result is equal to 5:
        display "✓ Addition test passed"
    otherwise:
        display "✗ Addition test failed: expected 5, got " with result
    end check
end action
```

2. **Run tests to confirm failure**:
```bash
wfl test_calculator.wfl
# Should show test failure initially
```

3. **Implement minimal code to pass**:
```wfl
define action add_numbers:
    needs:
        a as number
        b as number
    gives back:
        sum as number
    do:
        store sum as a plus b
        give back sum
end action
```

4. **Verify tests pass**:
```bash
wfl test_calculator.wfl
# Should show test success
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. Syntax Errors

**Error**: `Expected 'as' after identifier`
```wfl
// Wrong
store name "Alice"

// Correct
store name as "Alice"
```

**Error**: `Missing 'end' keyword`
```wfl
// Wrong
check if x is greater than 5:
    display "Greater"

// Correct
check if x is greater than 5:
    display "Greater"
end check
```

#### 2. Type Errors

**Error**: `Cannot add number and text`
```wfl
// Wrong
store result as 5 plus "hello"

// Correct - convert types first
store number_part as convert "5" to number
store result as number_part plus 10
```

**Error**: `Expected list but found text`
```wfl
// Wrong
store text as "hello"
store length as length of text  // This works for text too

// But for list operations:
store items as ["a", "b", "c"]
push of items and "d"  // Correct
```

#### 3. Runtime Errors

**Error**: `Division by zero`
```wfl
// Wrong
store result as 10 divided by 0

// Correct - check before dividing
check if divisor is not equal to 0:
    store result as 10 divided by divisor
otherwise:
    display "Error: Cannot divide by zero"
    store result as 0
end check
```

**Error**: `Variable not defined`
```wfl
// Wrong
display undefined_variable

// Correct - define variables before use
store my_variable as "Hello"
display my_variable
```

#### 4. Async/Await Issues

**Error**: `Async operation not awaited`
```wfl
// Wrong
open file at "data.txt" and read content as data

// Correct
wait for open file at "data.txt" and read content as data
```

**Error**: `Cannot use await in non-async function`
```wfl
// Wrong
define action read_file:
    wait for open file at "data.txt" and read content as data
end action

// Correct
define async action read_file:
    wait for open file at "data.txt" and read content as data
end action
```

#### 5. File and Network Issues

**Error**: `File not found`
```wfl
// Add error handling
try:
    wait for open file at "config.txt" and read content as config
when file_error:
    display "Config file not found, using defaults"
    store config as "{\"default\": true}"
end try
```

**Error**: `Network timeout`
```wfl
// Add timeout and retry logic
define async action fetch_with_retry:
    needs:
        url as text
        max_retries as number
    do:
        store attempts as 0
        
        repeat while attempts is less than max_retries:
            try:
                wait for open url at url and read content as response
                give back response
            when timeout_error:
                add 1 to attempts
                display "Attempt " with attempts with " failed, retrying..."
                wait for 1000 milliseconds
            end try
        end repeat
        
        display "All retry attempts failed"
        give back nothing
end action
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Use appropriate data structures**:
```wfl
// For frequent lookups, consider using contains() efficiently
store valid_users as ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
check if contains of valid_users and username:
    // Process valid user
end check
```

2. **Minimize file I/O operations**:
```wfl
// Read file once, process in memory
wait for open file at "large_data.txt" and read content as data
store lines as string_split of data and "\n"
for each line in lines:
    // Process each line
end for
```

3. **Use async operations for I/O**:
```wfl
// Good - non-blocking
define async action process_urls:
    for each url in urls:
        wait for open url at url and read content as response
        // Process response
    end for
end action
```

### Debugging Strategies

1. **Use print statements for debugging**:
```wfl
store x as 10
print "Debug: x =", x
store y as x times 2
print "Debug: y =", y
```

2. **Check variable types**:
```wfl
store value as some_function_call
print "Type of value:", typeof of value
print "Value:", value
```

3. **Use try-catch to isolate issues**:
```wfl
try:
    // Problematic code here
    store result as risky_operation
    print "Success:", result
catch:
    print "Error occurred in risky_operation"
end try
```

4. **Test with simple inputs first**:
```wfl
// Test with known good data
store test_data as ["apple", "banana"]
store result as process_list with test_data
print "Test result:", result
```

### Getting Help

1. **Use WFL CLI tools**:
   - `wfl --lint` for style issues
   - `wfl --analyze` for potential problems
   - `wfl --debug` for execution tracing

2. **Check error messages carefully** - WFL provides detailed, actionable error messages

3. **Refer to test programs** in `TestPrograms/` directory for working examples

4. **Follow TDD practices** - write tests to verify expected behavior

### Container System (Object-Oriented Programming)

WFL supports containers (similar to classes) for object-oriented programming:

```wfl
// Define a container
create container Person:
    property name as text
    property age as number default 0
    property email as text

    action greet:
        display "Hello, I am " with this.name with " and I am " with this.age with " years old."
    end action

    action set_age:
        needs:
            new_age as number
        do:
            check if new_age is greater than 0 and new_age is less than 150:
                change this.age to new_age
            otherwise:
                display "Invalid age: " with new_age
            end check
    end action

    action get_info:
        gives back:
            info as text
        do:
            store info as "Name: " with this.name with ", Age: " with this.age with ", Email: " with this.email
            give back info
    end action
end container

// Create and use container instances
store person1 as create Person with name as "Alice" and age as 30 and email as "alice@example.com"
perform greet on person1
perform set_age on person1 with new_age as 31
store info as perform get_info on person1
display info
```

### Container Inheritance
```wfl
// Base container
create container Animal:
    property name as text
    property species as text

    action make_sound:
        display this.name with " makes a sound"
    end action
end container

// Derived container
create container Dog extends Animal:
    property breed as text

    action make_sound:
        display this.name with " barks!"
    end action

    action fetch:
        display this.name with " fetches the ball"
    end action
end container

// Usage
store my_dog as create Dog with name as "Buddy" and species as "Canine" and breed as "Golden Retriever"
perform make_sound on my_dog  // "Buddy barks!"
perform fetch on my_dog       // "Buddy fetches the ball"
```

### Advanced Error Handling Patterns

```wfl
// Custom error types and handling
define action safe_divide:
    needs:
        numerator as number
        denominator as number
    gives back:
        result as number
    do:
        try:
            check if denominator is equal to 0:
                throw error "Division by zero is not allowed"
            end check

            store result as numerator divided by denominator
            give back result

        when math_error:
            display "Mathematical error: " with error_message
            give back 0
        when validation_error:
            display "Validation error: " with error_message
            give back nothing
        otherwise:
            display "Unexpected error: " with error_message
            give back nothing
        end try
end action

// Nested error handling
define async action process_file_safely:
    needs:
        filename as text
    do:
        try:
            // Outer try for file operations
            wait for open file at filename and read content as content

            try:
                // Inner try for data processing
                store lines as string_split of content and "\n"
                store processed as []

                for each line in lines:
                    try:
                        // Process each line safely
                        store cleaned as trim of line
                        check if length of cleaned is greater than 0:
                            push of processed and cleaned
                        end check
                    catch:
                        display "Warning: Could not process line: " with line
                    end try
                end for

                display "Successfully processed " with length of processed with " lines"

            when processing_error:
                display "Error processing file content"
            end try

        when file_error:
            display "Error: Could not read file " with filename
        when permission_error:
            display "Error: Permission denied for " with filename
        end try
end action
```

### Command-Line Argument Handling

WFL automatically provides command-line arguments through built-in variables:

```wfl
// Access command-line arguments
display "Total arguments: " with arg_count
display "All arguments: " with args

// Process flags
check if flag_verbose:
    display "Verbose mode enabled"
    store verbose as yes
otherwise:
    store verbose as no
end check

check if flag_output:
    store output_file as flag_output
    display "Output file: " with output_file
otherwise:
    store output_file as "output.txt"
end check

// Process positional arguments
check if length of positional_args is equal to 0:
    display "Usage: wfl script.wfl [options] file1 file2 ..."
    display "Options:"
    display "  --verbose        Enable verbose output"
    display "  --output FILE    Specify output file"
otherwise:
    for each input_file in positional_args:
        check if verbose:
            display "Processing: " with input_file
        end check

        try:
            wait for open file at input_file and read content as data
            // Process file data
            display "Processed " with length of data with " characters from " with input_file
        catch:
            display "Error: Could not process " with input_file
        end try
    end for
end check
```

### Web Server Advanced Features

                        store session as create empty map
                        set in sessions and session_id to session
                        display "New session: " with session_id
                    end check
