# Archived Development Notes

This directory contains historical development notes, research, and internal documentation that has been archived as part of the documentation cleanup project (December 2025).

## Why These Were Archived

These documents served their purpose during active development but are no longer part of the active documentation set:

1. **Historical value** - Show project evolution and decision-making process
2. **Superseded** - Information integrated into active documentation (technical/, guides/)
3. **Stale content** - Time-stamped notes from earlier development phases
4. **Reduced maintenance** - No longer need to keep in sync with current codebase

## Archived Files

### Project Planning & Tracking
- `wfl-todo.md` (92KB) - Historical roadmap and task tracking
- `wfl-int2.md` - System integration notes

### AI & Research Notes
- `wfl-devin.md` - AI assistant integration research
- `wfl-gemini-research.md` - Research notes
- `wfl-library-recommendations.md` - External library evaluations

### Bug Reports & Optimization
- `wfl-bug-reports.md` - **Useful patterns migrated to technical/testing.md**
- `wfl-memory-optimization.md` - **Tips migrated to technical/memory-profiling.md**

### Implementation Analysis
- `pattern-implementation-analysis.md` - Pattern matching implementation details

### Code Metrics (Obsolete)
- `rust_loc_report.md` - Line count report (use `tokei` or `cloc` for current metrics)
- `rust_loc_report_simple.md` - Simplified report
- `wfl_rust_loc_report.md` - WFL-specific report
- `wfl-rust-loc-counter.md` - Counter tool documentation
