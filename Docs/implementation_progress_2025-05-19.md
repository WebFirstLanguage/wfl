# Implementation Progress - May 19, 2025

## Completed

- Added file association for .wfl files in MSI installer
- Created MSI build launcher script in Tools directory (`launch_msi_build.py`)
- Created automated MSI installer build script for Windows (`build_msi.ps1`)
- Resolved version conflict issues in WiX Toolset configuration
- Implemented proper dependency checking for WiX Toolset and cargo-wix
- Added binary building step to ensure executable is available for packaging
- Enhanced error handling with clear user guidance and recovery paths
- Created comprehensive documentation for deployment process in `Docs/wfl-deployment.md`
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow for improved MSI building in CI/CD pipeline
- Enhanced versioning system with comprehensive updates across multiple files

## Key Improvements

1. **Fixed Parameter Handling**: Resolved conflict between command line parameters and WiX internal variables by directly modifying wix.toml
2. **Robust Dependency Management**: Added thorough checks for all required tools with helpful installation instructions
3. **Proper Package Selection**: Added workspace package specification to ensure correct binary is built
4. **Environmental Awareness**: Scripts now check for and prepare all required directories and files
5. **Documentation**: Created detailed deployment guide with troubleshooting and best practices
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with improved versioning, dependency checking, and artifact validation
7. **Smoke Testing**: Added automated testing of the installer in the CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details

- Created new MSI build launcher (`launch_msi_build.py`) with version management and documentation features
- Added automatic implementation progress updating to track build attempts
- Provided a unified command-line interface for version control and MSI building
- MSI installer now properly packages WFL with version 2025.4
- Added .wfl file association to MSI installer for seamless script execution
- Configured file icons for WFL script files
- Added both Open and Edit verbs to allow direct execution or editing of .wfl files
- Default configuration file is included in the installer
- Installer properly updates system PATH variable
- WiX source files are automatically generated if missing
- Scripts support both development and CI/CD environments
- GitHub Actions workflow includes extended error checking and reporting
- Improved artifact validation ensures only valid installers are published

## Comprehensive Versioning System

1. **Enhanced Version Script**:
   - Extended `scripts/bump_version.py` with comprehensive version management
   - Added support for updating all version references across the project
   - Created command-line flags for fine-grained control of update behavior
   - Implemented version consistency between core files and MSI installer

2. **Version Synchronization**:
   - `.build_meta.json`: Source of truth for year.build format (e.g., 2025.4)
   - `src/version.rs`: Core code version constant used by the application
   - `Cargo.toml`: Package and metadata versions in SemVer format
   - `wix.toml`: MSI installer version in Windows quad-format (year.build.0.0)
   - VS Code extensions: Synchronized version in package.json files

3. **Build Integration**:
   - Local builds: Integrated with `build_msi.ps1` for consistent versioning
   - CI/CD: Added workflow steps to manage versions in GitHub Actions
   - Removed error-prone `--define` parameter from cargo-wix commands

4. **User Controls**:
   - Added `--skip-bump` to use existing version without incrementing
   - Added `--update-all` to update all files with current version
   - Added `--update-wix-only` for MSI-only version updates
   - Added `--skip-git` to prevent automatic commits during builds

## GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements

1. **Enhanced Version Management**: 
   - Added version override input parameter for manual builds
   - Direct modification of wix.toml version instead of command line parameters
   - Added version validation and debugging output

2. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Added explicit dependency checks with clear error messages
   - Added binary verification before packaging
   - Added proper MSI verification after building
   - Added artifact validation before publishing

3. **Better Testing**:
   - Added smoke tests to verify installer functionality
   - Added checks for both WFL and LSP binaries

4. **Release Management**:
   - Improved release notes formatting
   - Added version and commit information to releases
   - Added verification steps for uploaded artifacts

## Next Steps

1. Implement digital code signing for the MSI installer
2. Extend build process to generate Debian packages for Linux
3. Add macOS package generation
4. Enhance automated testing for the installer
5. Add telemetry collection option (opt-in)
6. Add automated release notes generation based on commits
