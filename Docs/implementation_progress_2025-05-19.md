# Implementation Progress - May 19, 2025

## Completed

- Created automated MSI installer build script for Windows (`build_msi.ps1`)
- Resolved version conflict issues in WiX Toolset configuration
- Implemented proper dependency checking for WiX Toolset and cargo-wix
- Added binary building step to ensure executable is available for packaging
- Enhanced error handling with clear user guidance and recovery paths
- Created comprehensive documentation for deployment process in `Docs/wfl-deployment.md`
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow for improved MSI building in CI/CD pipeline

## Key Improvements

1. **Fixed Parameter Handling**: Resolved conflict between command line parameters and WiX internal variables by directly modifying wix.toml
2. **Robust Dependency Management**: Added thorough checks for all required tools with helpful installation instructions
3. **Proper Package Selection**: Added workspace package specification to ensure correct binary is built
4. **Environmental Awareness**: Scripts now check for and prepare all required directories and files
5. **Documentation**: Created detailed deployment guide with troubleshooting and best practices
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with improved versioning, dependency checking, and artifact validation
7. **Smoke Testing**: Added automated testing of the installer in the CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details

- MSI installer now properly packages WFL with version 2025.4
- Default configuration file is included in the installer
- Installer properly updates system PATH variable
- WiX source files are automatically generated if missing
- Scripts support both development and CI/CD environments
- GitHub Actions workflow includes extended error checking and reporting
- Improved artifact validation ensures only valid installers are published

## GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements

1. **Enhanced Version Management**: 
   - Added version override input parameter for manual builds
   - Direct modification of wix.toml version instead of command line parameters

2. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Added explicit dependency checks with clear error messages
   - Added binary verification before packaging
   - Added proper MSI verification after building
   - Added artifact validation before publishing

3. **Better Testing**:
   - Added smoke tests to verify installer functionality
   - Added checks for both WFL and LSP binaries

4. **Release Management**:
   - Improved release notes formatting
   - Added version and commit information to releases
   - Added verification steps for uploaded artifacts

## Next Steps

1. Implement digital code signing for the MSI installer
2. Extend build process to generate Debian packages for Linux
3. Add macOS package generation
4. Enhance automated testing for the installer
5. Add telemetry collection option (opt-in)
6. Add automated release notes generation based on commits
