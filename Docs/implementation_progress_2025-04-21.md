# Implementation Progress: 2025-04-21

## Linter and CLI Improvements
- Fixed linter CLI behavior to allow `--lint --fix` combination
- Removed unconditional linter run during normal execution
- Updated CLI help text to reflect new flag behavior
- Added integration test for `--lint --fix --diff` combined flags
- Added `total()` method to `FixerSummary` struct for better reporting
- Added `diff()` method to `CodeFixer` for better API consistency

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more integration tests for other flag combinations
- Explore adding configuration options for linter rules
- Consider implementing inline suppression with pragmas
