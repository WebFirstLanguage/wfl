**SECURITY UPDATE (September 2025):** This document describes the original WFLHASH specification. The implementation has been significantly enhanced with critical security fixes. See the [Security Improvements](#security-improvements) section for details on the current secure implementation.

## **Part I: Foundational Analysis of Modern Hashing Primitives**

### **Chapter 1: A Taxonomy of Hashing Functions and Design Philosophies**

#### **1.1 Introduction: The Evolutionary Trajectory of Cryptographic Hashes**

Cryptographic hash functions are fundamental primitives in modern information security. Their core function is to take an input of arbitrary size and produce a fixed-size output, known as a digest or hash, which serves as a compact and unique representation of the input data.1 An effective cryptographic hash function must satisfy three critical properties: it must be a one-way function, making it computationally infeasible to derive the original input from its digest (pre-image resistance); it must be collision-resistant, meaning it is infeasible to find two distinct inputs that produce the same digest; and it must exhibit the avalanche effect, where a minuscule change in the input results in a drastically different output.1 These properties enable a wide range of applications, including digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), data integrity verification, and blockchain technologies.1  
The history of cryptographic hashing is marked by a continuous cycle of innovation, deployment, cryptanalysis, and eventual obsolescence. Early standards like MD5 (Message Digest 5), which produces a 128-bit digest, were once ubiquitous in applications ranging from checksums to digital certificates.1 However, by 2004, critical vulnerabilities were discovered, demonstrating practical collision attacks that allowed for the creation of malicious files or forged certificates with the same hash as legitimate ones.1 This rendered MD5 insecure for any application requiring collision resistance.  
Its successor, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1), offered a larger 160-bit digest and was widely adopted in TLS certificates and version control systems like Git.1 Despite its initial promise, it too fell to advancing cryptanalytic techniques. In 2017, the "SHAttered" attack demonstrated the first practical chosen-prefix collision for SHA-1, effectively breaking the algorithm for security-critical uses.1 Consequently, NIST and major browser vendors deprecated its use, mandating a transition to stronger alternatives.1  
This historical progression reveals a crucial pattern: cryptographic algorithms, particularly those based on similar underlying mathematical structures, can suffer from class-wide breaks. The failures of MD5 and SHA-1, both based on the Merkle–Damgård construction, underscore the inherent risk of cryptographic monoculture. The response from the cryptographic community has been twofold: first, the development of stronger, iterative improvements like the SHA-2 family (SHA-256, SHA-512), which remain secure to date 1; and second, the proactive design of algorithms with fundamentally different architectures. The SHA-3 standard, based on a novel "sponge construction," was explicitly chosen to serve as a robust backup to SHA-2, ensuring that a future break in the SHA-2 family would not leave the digital world without a secure alternative.1 This evolutionary context—a landscape of broken predecessors, a reliable but aging incumbent, and a diverse set of modern challengers—provides the essential motivation for designing WFLHASH, an algorithm that learns from the past to build a more resilient future.

#### **1.2 The Great Divergence: General-Purpose vs. Application-Specific Hashing**

The term "hashing" encompasses a broad range of functions with vastly different design goals. A critical distinction must be made between general-purpose cryptographic hashes and application-specific hashes, particularly those designed for password storage. The user query's objective to combine the "best" features of the top ten algorithms necessitates a formal clarification of this distinction, as the optimal characteristics for one domain are often antithetical to the needs of another.  
General-purpose hash functions, such as SHA-2, SHA-3, and the BLAKE family, are engineered for speed. Their primary role in applications like file integrity checks, digital signatures, or blockchain mining demands high throughput. For these use cases, performance is a feature, allowing systems to process large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. BLAKE3, for example, is lauded for being "very fast," achieving speeds comparable to the broken MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms but with far superior security guarantees.1 This performance is a direct result of a memory-light design that is highly optimized for modern CPUs.1  
In stark contrast, password-hashing functions are designed to be deliberately slow and resource-intensive. Their purpose is to protect stored password credentials against offline brute-force attacks, where an adversary can test billions of password guesses per second using specialized hardware like GPUs or ASICs. To thwart such attacks, algorithms like Argon2, the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, are designed to be "memory-hard".1 By requiring a significant amount of RAM to compute a single hash, Argon2 dramatically increases the cost of a brute-force attack, as memory is far more expensive to parallelize on a massive scale than simple computational logic.1 The document explicitly notes that Argon2's high resource consumption is a feature that "strains systems with limited RAM" to provide strong security.1  
This creates a fundamental design conflict: the speed that makes BLAKE3 excellent for general-purpose hashing makes it "not appropriate for password hashing," as attackers can brute-force its hashes too quickly.1 Conversely, the memory-hardness that makes Argon2 the recommended choice for password storage makes it unacceptably slow for high-throughput applications. Therefore, a synthesis of  
*all* "best" features is impossible. The design of WFLHASH must begin with a clear declaration of its intended domain. WFLHASH is specified as a **high-performance, general-purpose cryptographic hash function**. It is not a Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) and must not be used for password storage or key derivation where resistance to brute-force attacks is the primary security goal. For such applications, memory-hard functions like Argon2id remain the recommended standard.1

#### **1.3 A Survey of Core Constructions**

The security, performance, and feature set of a hash function are dictated by its underlying architectural design. The ten algorithms under review represent a diverse array of cryptographic constructions, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. A systematic comparison of these core principles is essential for synthesizing an optimal design for WFLHASH.  
The oldest and most established design is the **Merkle–Damgård construction**, which forms the basis of the MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 families. This iterative structure processes input messages in fixed-size blocks, feeding the output of a compression function from one block into the next. While proven and well-understood, this design is the source of the length-extension vulnerability that affects all three families.1  
A significant architectural departure is the **sponge construction**, which is the foundation of the SHA-3 (Keccak) family.1 A sponge function operates on a finite internal state, "absorbing" input data in blocks and then "squeezing" out an arbitrary amount of output. This design is not only elegant but also provides inherent immunity to length-extension attacks and naturally supports extendable-output functions (XOFs).1  
Other algorithms are built upon primitives from different areas of cryptography. The **BLAKE2** and **BLAKE3** algorithms derive their exceptional speed from an internal permutation based on the **ChaCha stream cipher**, a design renowned for its high performance in software on general-purpose CPUs.1 This approach demonstrates the power of leveraging well-optimized and widely-studied components. Similarly,  
**Whirlpool** is based on a modified version of the **AES block cipher**, allowing it to potentially leverage hardware acceleration already present in systems that use AES for encryption.1  
Finally, some algorithms are designed with specific hardware targets in mind. **Tiger**, for instance, was explicitly designed for high performance on 64-bit processors, a forward-looking choice at the time of its creation.1 The following table provides a comparative summary of these foundational characteristics.  
**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Source Algorithm Characteristics**

| Algorithm | Year Introduced | Digest Size(s) (bits) | Core Principle / Construction | Key Performance Characteristic | Current Security Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **MD5** | 1992 | 128 | Merkle–Damgård | Fast in software | Broken (Collisions) 1 |
| **SHA-1** | 1995 | 160 | Merkle–Damgård | Faster than SHA-256 | Broken (Collisions) 1 |
| **SHA-2** | 2001 | 224, 256, 384, 512 | Merkle–Damgård | Widely supported, secure | Secure 1 |
| **SHA-3** | 2015 | 224, 256, 384, 512, XOF | Sponge Construction (Keccak) | Slower than SHA-2 in software | Secure 1 |
| **BLAKE2** | 2012 | Variable (up to 512\) | ChaCha-based permutation | Faster than SHA-256 | Secure 1 |
| **BLAKE3** | 2020 | 256 (default), XOF | ChaCha-based, Tree Hashing | Extremely fast, parallelizable | Secure 1 |
| **RIPEMD-160** | 1996 | 160 | Merkle–Damgård variant | Efficient computation | Secure (Caution) 1 |
| **Whirlpool** | 2000 | 512 | AES-based block cipher | Slower than others | Secure 1 |
| **Tiger** | 1995 | 192 (or 128, 160\) | Designed for 64-bit CPUs | Fast on 64-bit hardware | Secure (Caution) 1 |
| **Argon2** | 2015 | Variable | Memory-hard function | Deliberately slow, high RAM usage | Secure (for passwords) 1 |

### **Chapter 2: The Architectural Pursuit of Security**

#### **2.1 Beyond Collisions: The Threat of Length-Extension Attacks**

While collision resistance is a headline security property, a modern hash function must defend against a broader spectrum of attacks. One of the most persistent and subtle vulnerabilities in cryptographic protocol design is the length-extension attack. This attack class plagues algorithms based on the Merkle–Damgård construction, including the otherwise secure SHA-2 family.1  
The vulnerability arises from the final output of a Merkle–Damgård hash. The digest is, in essence, the final internal state of the hashing process. An attacker who knows the hash of a message, \`H(secret |  
| message), but not the secretitself, can use this hash as the initial state to continue hashing additional data. This allows them to computeH(secret |  
| message |  
| padding |  
| attacker\_data)without ever knowing thesecret. This flaw can be catastrophic in naive authentication schemes that rely on a simple HASH(key | data)\` construction for message authentication. While this can be mitigated by using a proper keyed-hash construction like HMAC, the vulnerability in the underlying primitive places a significant burden on the developer to implement it correctly, violating the principle of "safe by default" design.  
The analysis of the top ten algorithms reveals a clear and superior solution to this problem. The SHA-3 family, by virtue of its sponge construction, is "Not vulnerable to length-extension attacks".1 The sponge function's design separates the internal state from the final output in a way that prevents this type of manipulation. The "capacity" portion of the internal state is never directly outputted nor affected by the message input in the same way, breaking the chain that enables the attack.  
This inherent immunity is not merely an incremental improvement; it represents a fundamental security upgrade over the entire lineage of Merkle–Damgård-based hashes. By adopting the sponge construction, a new algorithm can eliminate an entire class of protocol-level vulnerabilities by design. This provides a higher baseline of security and simplifies the task for developers building secure systems. For this reason, the adoption of the sponge construction is a non-negotiable architectural foundation for WFLHASH. It is a defining "best" feature inherited from SHA-3, chosen to build a function that is structurally more robust and safer to use than its SHA-2 predecessors.

#### **2.2 The Security Margin: Lessons from RIPEMD-160 and Tiger**

The security of a cryptographic algorithm should not be viewed as a simple binary state of "secure" or "broken." A more nuanced and forward-looking metric is the algorithm's **security margin**: the difference between the number of computational rounds in the full algorithm and the number of rounds that have been successfully attacked by cryptanalysts. The cases of RIPEMD-160 and Tiger provide critical lessons on the importance of designing algorithms with a large and durable security margin.  
RIPEMD-160, which uses 80 rounds in its full implementation, has seen collision attacks on reduced-round variants of up to 40 rounds.1 Similarly, the full 24-round version of Tiger remains unbroken, but researchers have successfully found collisions for versions reduced to between 16 and 22 rounds.1 NIST has explicitly noted that such findings on reduced-round Tiger "raise concerns" about its long-term viability.1  
These attacks, while not immediately practical against the full algorithms, are significant leading indicators of potential future failure. Cryptanalysis is an incremental process. Advances in techniques or computing power rarely break a full algorithm outright; instead, they slowly chip away at its defenses, breaking progressively more rounds over time. A shrinking security margin is therefore a strong predictor of eventual obsolescence. An algorithm with attacks demonstrated against 22 of its 24 rounds, like Tiger, is living on borrowed time.  
This principle has profound implications for the design of a new hash function intended for long-term use. WFLHASH must be designed with a highly conservative number of internal rounds in its core permutation function. The number of rounds should not be chosen merely to thwart current known attacks but to provide a substantial buffer against future, unforeseen advances in cryptanalysis. By learning from the cautionary tales of RIPEMD-160 and Tiger, WFLHASH will be specified with a security margin that instills confidence in its longevity and resilience.

### **Chapter 3: The Engineering of Performance: Speed and Parallelism**

#### **3.1 The Software Performance Revolution: The BLAKE Family**

For a general-purpose hash function, performance is a critical feature, second only to security. In many applications, such as network protocols, storage systems, and real-time data validation, the speed of the hash function can be a significant performance bottleneck. The analysis of the top algorithms reveals that the greatest leaps in software performance have come from the BLAKE family.1  
BLAKE2 is documented as being "significantly faster than SHA-256 and MD5," while BLAKE3 achieves speeds "comparable to MD5 and SHA-1" but with modern security guarantees.1 This remarkable performance is not accidental; it is the direct result of a deliberate design choice. Both BLAKE2 and BLAKE3 are based on the ChaCha stream cipher's core permutation.1 The ChaCha permutation is built exclusively from a set of simple operations known as ARX: 32- or 64-bit  
**A**ddition, **R**otation, and **X**OR. These operations map directly and efficiently to single instructions on virtually all modern CPUs, from high-end servers to low-power mobile devices. This allows compilers to produce highly optimized machine code, resulting in exceptional software performance.  
This stands in contrast to algorithms like SHA-2, which uses more complex operations, or SHA-3, which, while elegant, is "typically slower in software than SHA-2" and has less mature hardware acceleration support.1 The success of the BLAKE family demonstrates that the core permutation engine is the primary determinant of a hash function's speed. It also proves that it is possible to achieve top-tier performance without compromising security by building upon well-understood, high-speed cryptographic primitives.  
This leads to a powerful synthesis for the design of WFLHASH. The optimal approach is a hybrid one: to combine the structurally superior and highly secure **sponge construction** from SHA-3 with a faster, BLAKE-style **internal permutation** based on ARX principles. This strategy directly merges the "best" security architecture (inherent immunity to length-extension attacks) with the "best" performance engine (optimized for modern CPUs). This hybrid design forms the central thesis of WFLHASH, aiming to deliver the security of SHA-3 at the speed of BLAKE3.

#### **3.2 Embracing Modern Hardware: Natively Parallel Hashing**

In the contemporary computing landscape, multi-core processors are ubiquitous. From data center servers with dozens of cores to standard smartphones with octa-core CPUs, parallel processing capability is the norm. A hash function designed today that can only execute as a single, sequential process is an anachronism; it fails to harness the vast majority of available computational power, especially when processing large inputs.  
The BLAKE family, particularly BLAKE3, represents a paradigm shift in hash function design by making parallelism a native, first-class feature. BLAKE2 introduced a "tree-hashing mode for parallelism," and BLAKE3 refined this concept, being "highly parallelizable, making it efficient on multi-core processors".1 The tree-hashing architecture works by breaking a large input message into independent chunks. Each chunk can be hashed simultaneously on a separate core or thread. The resulting intermediate hashes (leaf nodes) are then combined and hashed together in parent nodes, continuing up the tree until a single root hash is produced.  
This architecture provides a near-linear performance scaling with the number of available cores. Hashing a multi-gigabyte file can be dramatically accelerated, reducing processing time from minutes to seconds. Furthermore, this design naturally lends itself to streaming contexts, where data arrives in chunks over time. As noted for BLAKE3, this structure is highly "suitable for streaming contexts where incremental hashing is needed".1  
For WFLHASH to be a truly next-generation algorithm, it must not merely permit parallelism but be designed around it from the ground up. A sequential mode of operation will be supported for small inputs, but the primary, default mode for inputs exceeding a certain block size will be a tree-hashing mode directly inspired by the architecture of BLAKE3. This ensures that WFLHASH is maximally efficient on all modern hardware, delivering the highest possible throughput by fully utilizing the parallel processing capabilities of today's CPUs.

## **Part II: Specification of the WFLHASH Algorithm**

### **Chapter 4: WFLHASH Design Rationale and Core Principles**

WFLHASH is a general-purpose cryptographic hash function engineered to provide a superior combination of security, performance, and flexibility, derived from a synthesis of the most advanced features found in contemporary hashing algorithms. Its design is guided by four core principles, each addressing a key lesson learned from the analysis of existing standards.

* **Principle 1: Security First (Sponge Construction).** To provide robust, "safe-by-default" security, WFLHASH adopts the sponge construction, as pioneered by SHA-3.1 This architectural choice provides inherent immunity to the entire class of length-extension attacks that affect the Merkle–Damgård family of hashes, including SHA-2.1 This eliminates a common source of protocol-level vulnerabilities and raises the baseline security of the primitive itself.  
* **Principle 2: Performance by Design (ChaCha-based Permutation).** To achieve maximum throughput in software on a wide range of modern processors, WFLHASH utilizes an internal permutation function built on Add-Rotate-XOR (ARX) operations. This approach is inspired by the exceptional performance of the BLAKE2 and BLAKE3 algorithms, which leverage the highly optimized ChaCha stream cipher permutation.1 This ensures that WFLHASH is computationally efficient and well-suited for high-speed applications.  
* **Principle 3: Native Parallelism (Tree Hashing).** Recognizing that modern computing is parallel, WFLHASH integrates a tree-hashing mode as its default mechanism for processing large inputs. This architecture, drawn from the designs of BLAKE2 and BLAKE3, allows a single hashing job to be split across multiple CPU cores, achieving near-linear performance scaling.1 This makes WFLHASH optimally efficient on multi-core servers, desktops, and mobile devices.  
* **Principle 4: Built-in Versatility (XOF and Keyed Modes).** To serve a broad array of cryptographic use cases from a single, unified primitive, WFLHASH provides native support for multiple functional modes. This includes an extendable-output function (XOF) mode, similar to SHA-3's SHAKE, for applications requiring an arbitrary amount of pseudorandom output, and a built-in keyed hashing mode for generating secure Message Authentication Codes (MACs), as implemented in BLAKE2.1 This versatility is managed through a simple parameter block, allowing for explicit and unambiguous configuration.

### **Chapter 5: The WFLHASH Core: A Hybrid Sponge Construction**

#### **5.1 The Sponge Construction Overview**

The WFLHASH algorithm is an instance of the sponge construction. This construction operates on a fixed-size internal state, which is conceptually divided into two parts: the **rate** (r) and the **capacity** (c). The size of the state is b=r+c.  
The operation proceeds in two phases:

1. **Absorbing Phase:** The input message is padded and divided into blocks of r bits. In each step, a message block is XORed into the rate portion of the state, and then a fixed, unkeyed permutation function, WFLHASH-P, is applied to the entire state. This process is repeated until all message blocks have been absorbed.  
2. **Squeezing Phase:** The output digest is generated. In each step, the rate portion of the state is returned as an output block, and the permutation WFLHASH-P is applied to the state. This can be repeated to produce an output of any desired length.

The security of the sponge construction is determined by the size of the capacity, c. For a hash function to provide k bits of security against collision attacks, the capacity must be at least 2k bits (c≥2k). For pre-image resistance, the capacity must be at least k bits (c≥k).

#### **5.2 The WFLHASH Internal State**

The internal state of WFLHASH is 1024 bits (b=1024). This state is organized as a 4×4 matrix of 64-bit words, for a total of 16 words. This structure is chosen for optimal performance on 64-bit processors, a design consideration also noted for the Tiger hash function.1  
State=​S0,0​S1,0​S2,0​S3,0​​S0,1​S1,1​S2,1​S3,1​​S0,2​S1,2​S2,2​S3,2​​S0,3​S1,3​S2,3​S3,3​​​  
Each Si,j​ is a 64-bit unsigned integer. All operations are performed modulo 264\.

#### **5.3 The WFLHASH-P Permutation Function**

The core of the WFLHASH algorithm is its internal permutation function, WFLHASH-P. This function is designed for high speed and a large security margin. WFLHASH-P consists of 12 rounds of computation. The choice of 12 rounds is a conservative one, intended to provide a substantial buffer against future advances in cryptanalysis, learning from the diminished security margins of algorithms like Tiger and RIPEMD-160.1  
Each round of WFLHASH-P consists of two main steps: a column step and a row step.

1. **Column Step:** A function G is applied to each of the four columns of the state matrix. The G function takes four 64-bit words (a,b,c,d) as input and updates them using ARX operations inspired by the ChaCha/BLAKE quarter-round.  
   * a←a+b; d←(d⊕a)⋙R1​;  
   * c←c+d; b←(b⊕c)⋙R2​;  
   * a←a+b; d←(d⊕a)⋙R3​;  
   * c←c+d; b←(b⊕c)⋙R4​;  
     Where \+ denotes addition modulo 264, $\\oplus$ is bitwise XOR, and $\\ggg R$ is a right bitwise rotation by R bits. The rotation constants (R1​,R2​,R3​,R4​) are carefully chosen to ensure good diffusion. For example: R1​=32,R2​=24,R3​=16,R4​=63.  
2. **Row Step:** The G function is then applied to each of the four rows of the state matrix.

A round constant, derived from a simple linear-feedback shift register (LFSR), is XORed into the state word S0,0​ at the beginning of each round to break the symmetry of the permutation.

### **Chapter 6: Natively Parallel Operation: The WFLHASH Tree Hashing Mode**

#### **6.1 Tree Hashing Architecture**

To fully leverage modern multi-core processors, WFLHASH's primary mode of operation for inputs larger than a single chunk (e.g., 1024 bytes) is tree hashing. This architecture is directly inspired by the highly parallelizable designs of BLAKE2 and BLAKE3.1  
The input message is first divided into a sequence of 1024-byte chunks. These chunks form the leaf nodes of a binary tree. The degree of parallelism is determined by the number of available threads or cores, allowing the system to process multiple chunks simultaneously.

#### **6.2 Leaf Node Hashing**

Each 1024-byte chunk is hashed independently and in parallel. To distinguish these hashes from other operations, a "leaf node" flag is set within the WFLHASH parameter block for each computation. The output of hashing each leaf node is a fixed-size digest (e.g., 256 or 512 bits).

#### **6.3 Parent and Root Node Hashing**

Once the leaf node hashes are computed, they are combined by parent nodes. The digests of two child nodes are concatenated to form the input for their parent node's hash computation. A "parent node" flag is set in the parameter block for these operations. This process continues up the tree, with each level combining the outputs of the level below it, until a single "root node" hash is produced. This final digest is the output of the entire hashing operation.

#### **6.4 Streaming and Incremental Hashing**

This tree-based architecture provides natural support for streaming and incremental hashing, a key feature highlighted in BLAKE3.1 In a streaming context, as new chunks of data become available, they can be hashed as leaf nodes. The tree can be updated incrementally without needing to re-process the entire message from the beginning. This makes WFLHASH highly efficient for applications involving large, dynamic data streams, such as live video processing, network data transfer, or large file verification.

### **Chapter 7: The WFLHASH Family: Parameterization and Functional Modes**

To enhance flexibility and address a wide range of use cases, WFLHASH is not a single function but a family of functions configurable via a parameter block. This design is inspired by the versatility of BLAKE2, which supports features like personalization and keyed hashing through a similar mechanism.1

#### **7.1 Parameter Block**

Every WFLHASH computation is initialized with a parameter block. This structure allows the caller to specify key attributes of the operation, including:

* **Digest Length:** The desired output size in bytes.  
* **Key Length:** For keyed mode (WFLMAC), the length of the authentication key.  
* **Mode Flags:** Bits to specify the operational mode (e.g., standard hash, XOF, leaf node, parent node, root node).  
* **Personalization Salt:** An optional value to create distinct hash functions for different purposes.

#### **7.2 Fixed-Output Variants: WFLHASH-256 and WFLHASH-512**

For general-purpose use and interoperability, two primary fixed-output variants are defined. This approach mirrors the flexibility offered by the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families, which provide multiple digest sizes.1

* **WFLHASH-256:** The default and recommended variant, producing a 256-bit digest. It provides 128 bits of security against both collision and pre-image attacks.  
* **WFLHASH-512:** A variant for applications requiring a higher security level, producing a 512-bit digest. It provides 256 bits of security.

#### **7.3 Extendable-Output Function (XOF): WFLXOF**

Inspired by SHA-3's SHAKE and BLAKE3's extendable-output capabilities, WFLHASH includes an XOF mode, designated WFLXOF.1 In this mode, after the absorbing phase is complete, the squeezing phase can be continued indefinitely to produce a stream of pseudorandom bits of any desired length. This is useful for applications such as key generation, randomized padding schemes, and stream encryption.

#### **7.4 Keyed Hashing and MAC: WFLMAC**

WFLHASH provides a built-in mode for message authentication, WFLMAC, which is more efficient and secure than the generic HMAC construction. This feature is modeled on the integrated keyed hashing of BLAKE2.1 When a key is provided via the parameter block, it is securely mixed into the initial state of the hash function. The resulting digest serves as a highly secure Message Authentication Code, verifying both the integrity and authenticity of the message.  
**Table 2: WFLHASH Family Parameterization**

| Variant Name | Internal State Size (bits) | Rate (r) (bits) | Capacity (c) (bits) | Default Digest Length (bits) | Security Level (Collision / Pre-image) (bits) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **WFLHASH-256** | 1024 | 512 | 512 | 256 | 128 / 128 |
| **WFLHASH-512** | 1024 | 512 | 512 | 512 | 256 / 256 |
| **WFLXOF** | 1024 | 512 | 512 | Arbitrary | 128 / 128 |
| **WFLMAC-256** | 1024 | 512 | 512 | 256 | N/A / 128 (Forgery Resistance) |

## **Part III: Security Profile and Implementation Guidance**

### **Chapter 8: Preliminary Security Analysis**

The security of WFLHASH is derived from the combination of a proven cryptographic structure (the sponge construction) and a robust internal permutation (WFLHASH-P) with a large security margin.

#### **8.1 Collision Resistance**

Collision resistance is primarily determined by the size of the capacity, c. For WFLHASH-256, the capacity is 512 bits. The generic birthday attack against a sponge construction requires approximately 2c/2 operations. Therefore, finding a collision for WFLHASH-256 would require on the order of 2256 operations, which is computationally infeasible. The security is bounded by the digest size, providing 128 bits of collision resistance for a 256-bit output.

#### **8.2 Pre-image Resistance**

Pre-image resistance also depends on the capacity and the one-way nature of the permutation function. A generic pre-image attack requires approximately 2c/2 operations. With a 512-bit capacity, this provides 256 bits of security, well above the 128-bit target for WFLHASH-256. The security is again bounded by the digest size, providing 128 bits of pre-image resistance.

#### **8.3 Length-Extension Attack Resistance**

WFLHASH is immune to length-extension attacks by design. This is a direct and intentional consequence of adopting the sponge construction from SHA-3.1 The internal state's capacity portion is not exposed in the output, breaking the mechanism that allows for such attacks in Merkle–Damgård-based functions like SHA-256.1

#### **8.4 Side-Channel Attack Considerations**

Implementations of WFLHASH must be constant-time to prevent side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks). The design of the WFLHASH-P permutation facilitates this. Its exclusive use of ARX operations (bitwise addition, rotation, and XOR) avoids data-dependent branches and memory lookups, which are common sources of timing leaks. This is a significant advantage over algorithms that use large S-boxes, such as Tiger, which can be more complex to implement in a constant-time manner.1

### **Chapter 9: Recommended Applications and Usage Protocols**

#### **9.1 Intended Use Cases**

WFLHASH is designed as a high-performance, secure, and versatile primitive suitable for a wide range of applications where speed and integrity are paramount. Recommended use cases include:

* **Digital Signatures:** Generating compact and collision-resistant digests of messages for signing with algorithms like ECDSA or RSA.  
* **File Integrity and Checksums:** Efficiently verifying the integrity of large files, software distributions, and data archives, leveraging the native parallelism of the tree-hashing mode.  
* **Message Authentication Codes (MACs):** Using the built-in WFLMAC mode to provide fast and secure message authentication, replacing slower HMAC constructions.  
* **Blockchain and Merkle Trees:** Constructing Merkle trees efficiently due to the parallelizable tree-hashing architecture, making it ideal for cryptocurrencies and other distributed ledger technologies.  
* **Pseudorandom Number Generation:** Using the WFLXOF mode as a building block for deterministic random bit generators (DRBGs).

#### **9.2 Prohibited Use Cases: The Password Hashing Admonition**

It is critically important to state that WFLHASH is **not suitable for password hashing or password storage**. A strong, explicit warning is issued against such use.  
WFLHASH is intentionally designed for high speed and computational efficiency. These are desirable properties for a general-purpose hash function but are catastrophic weaknesses in a password-hashing context. An adversary with access to a database of WFLHASH-based password digests could use GPUs or other specialized hardware to execute billions or trillions of guesses per second, making brute-force attacks highly practical.  
For the specific task of password storage, a memory-hard algorithm is required. The recommended modern standard is **Argon2id**, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition.1 Argon2id's design deliberately consumes large amounts of memory to raise the cost and slow down brute-force attacks, providing the necessary protection that a fast hash like WFLHASH cannot.1 Systems requiring password storage should use Argon2id, scrypt, or another recognized memory-hard function.

#### **9.3 Conclusion and Future Outlook**

WFLHASH represents a deliberate and justified synthesis of the most advanced and proven concepts in modern cryptographic hash function design. It does not reinvent core principles but rather combines best-in-class components into a single, optimized algorithm. By adopting the secure sponge construction of SHA-3, it achieves immunity to length-extension attacks. By integrating a fast, ARX-based permutation inspired by BLAKE3, it delivers elite software performance. By making tree hashing a native feature, it fully embraces the parallel nature of modern hardware. Finally, by providing a flexible family of functions, it serves a multitude of cryptographic needs with a single, robust primitive.  
The design choices are a direct response to the evolutionary history of hashing, aiming to provide a function that is not only secure today but is engineered with the longevity required to remain secure well into the future. The following table summarizes the lineage of WFLHASH's core features, directly mapping its design to the strengths of the algorithms that inspired it.

## **Security Improvements (September 2025)**

The WFLHASH implementation has undergone comprehensive security enhancements to address vulnerabilities identified in the original specification. These improvements maintain backward compatibility for the API while significantly strengthening the cryptographic security.

### **Critical Security Fixes Implemented**

#### **1. Strong Initialization Vectors**
- **Issue**: Original implementation used predictable initialization patterns
- **Fix**: Implemented cryptographically strong initialization vectors derived from mathematical constants (cube roots of primes)
- **Impact**: Eliminates predictable state initialization vulnerabilities

#### **2. Increased Round Count**
- **Issue**: Original specification used only 12 rounds, insufficient for adequate security margin
- **Fix**: Increased to 24 rounds for WFLHASH-P permutation
- **Impact**: Provides substantial security margin against future cryptanalytic advances

#### **3. Proper Padding with Length Encoding**
- **Issue**: Original padding scheme was vulnerable to collision attacks
- **Fix**: Implemented proper padding that includes message length encoding
- **Impact**: Prevents length-extension style attacks and collision vulnerabilities

#### **4. Strong Round Constants**
- **Issue**: Round constants were predictable (sequential numbers)
- **Fix**: Implemented "nothing-up-my-sleeve" round constants derived from mathematical constants
- **Impact**: Eliminates slide attacks and other constant-related vulnerabilities

#### **5. Input Validation and Size Limits**
- **Issue**: No input size validation, potential for resource exhaustion
- **Fix**: Added 100MB input size limit with proper error handling
- **Impact**: Prevents denial-of-service attacks through excessive memory usage

#### **6. Timing-Safe Operation Measures**
- **Issue**: Implementation vulnerable to timing-based side-channel attacks
- **Fix**: Added constant-time operation hints and timing-safe measures
- **Impact**: Reduces vulnerability to timing-based cryptanalytic attacks

#### **7. Enhanced G-Function Diffusion**
- **Issue**: Poor rotation constants led to weak avalanche effect
- **Fix**: Implemented proven rotation constants from ChaCha20 for better diffusion
- **Impact**: Improved avalanche effect and resistance to differential attacks

#### **8. Personalization and Salt Support**
- **Issue**: No support for personalization or salt parameters
- **Fix**: Added `wflhash256_with_salt()` and `wflmac256()` functions
- **Impact**: Enables domain separation and secure MAC functionality

### **New API Functions**

The security improvements introduce new functions while maintaining backward compatibility:

```wfl
// Enhanced hash function with salt/personalization support
store salted_hash as wflhash256_with_salt of message and salt

// Message Authentication Code functionality
store mac as wflmac256 of message and key
```

### **Breaking Changes**

**Hash Value Changes**: Due to the security improvements, hash values produced by the current implementation differ from the original specification. This is expected and indicates that the security vulnerabilities have been properly addressed.

**Performance Impact**: The increased round count (12 → 24 rounds) results in approximately 2x computational cost, but this is necessary for adequate security margin.

### **Security Validation**

The security improvements have been validated through comprehensive testing:
- 8 security vulnerability tests covering all identified issues
- Avalanche effect testing confirming proper diffusion
- Input validation testing with size limits
- Timing consistency testing for side-channel resistance
- Full regression testing ensuring no functionality loss

### **Recommendations**

1. **Use the Enhanced Implementation**: Always use the current secure implementation rather than the original specification
2. **Leverage New Features**: Use `wflhash256_with_salt()` for domain separation and `wflmac256()` for authentication
3. **Validate Integration**: Test your applications with the new hash values
4. **Monitor Performance**: The 2x performance cost is acceptable for the security gains

The enhanced WFLHASH implementation now provides cryptographically sound security while maintaining the high-performance characteristics described in the original specification.
