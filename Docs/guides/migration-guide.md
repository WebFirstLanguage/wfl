## General Philosophy

### Traditional Programming Languages
Most programming languages use:
- Symbols and operators (`==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`)
- Curly braces `{}` for blocks
- Semicolons `;` for statement termination
- Cryptic keywords (`func`, `def`, `class`)

### WFL Philosophy
WFL uses:
- Natural English words (`is`, `is not`, `and`, `or`)
- `end` keywords for block termination
- Natural sentence structure
- Descriptive keywords (`action`, `container`, `check if`)

**Example Comparison:**
```javascript
// JavaScript
if (user.isActive && user.age >= 18) {
    console.log("Welcome!");
} else {
    console.log("Access denied");
}
```

```wfl
// WFL
check if user is active and user age is greater than or equal to 18:
    display "Welcome!"
otherwise:
    display "Access denied"
end check
```

## From JavaScript

### Variables and Constants

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
let userName = "Alice";
const maxAge = 65;
var isActive = true;
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store user name as "Alice"
store max age as 65
store is active as yes
```

### Functions

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
function greetUser(name, age) {
    return `Hello ${name}, you are ${age} years old`;
}

const result = greetUser("Alice", 30);
console.log(result);
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
define action called greet user:
    parameter name as Text
    parameter age as Number
    
    return "Hello " with name with ", you are " with age with " years old"
end action

store result as greet user with "Alice" and 30
display result
```

### Objects and Classes

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);
    }
    
    celebrateBirthday() {
        this.age++;
        console.log(`Happy birthday! Now ${this.age}`);
    }
}

const person = new Person("Alice", 30);
person.greet();
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
create container Person:
    property name as Text
    property age as Number
    
    action greet:
        display "Hi, I'm " with name
    end action
    
    action celebrate birthday:
        store age as age plus 1
        display "Happy birthday! Now " with age
    end action
end container

create new Person as person:
    name is "Alice"
    age is 30
end

person.greet()
```

### Arrays and Loops

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(fruits[i]);
}

// For-each
fruits.forEach(fruit => {
    console.log(`I like ${fruit}`);
});

// While loop
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store fruits as ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

// Index-based loop
count from 0 to (length of fruits minus 1):
    display fruits at count
end count

// For-each loop
for each fruit in fruits:
    display "I like " with fruit
end for

// While loop
store count as 0
while count is less than 5:
    display count
    store count as count plus 1
end while
```

### Async/Await

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
        const userData = await response.json();
        return userData;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to fetch user:", error);
        return null;
    }
}

const user = await fetchUserData(123);
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
define action called fetch user data:
    parameter user id as Number
    
    try:
        store response as await web.get("/api/users/" with user id)
        store user data as parse json from response.body
        return user data
    catch error:
        display "Failed to fetch user: " with error.message
        return nothing
    end try
end action

store user as await fetch user data with 123
```

### Promises and Callbacks

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Promise-based
function processData(data) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if (data.length > 0) {
                resolve(data.toUpperCase());
            } else {
                reject(new Error("Empty data"));
            }
        }, 1000);
    });
}

processData("hello")
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
define action called process data:
    parameter data as Text
    
    wait 1 second
    
    check if length of data is greater than 0:
        return touppercase of data
    otherwise:
        throw error "Empty data"
    end check
end action

try:
    store result as await process data with "hello"
    display result
catch error:
    display "Error: " with error.message
end try
```

## From Python

### Variables and Types

**Python:**
```python
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = 30
is_active = True
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
user_data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store user name as "Alice"
store user age as 30
store is active as yes
store items as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
store user data as {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```

### Functions and Default Parameters

**Python:**
```python
def greet_user(name, greeting="Hello", punctuation="!"):
    return f"{greeting} {name}{punctuation}"

result = greet_user("Alice")
result2 = greet_user("Bob", "Hi", ".")
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
define action called greet user:
    parameter name as Text
    parameter greeting as Text default "Hello"
    parameter punctuation as Text default "!"
    
    return greeting with " " with name with punctuation
end action

store result as greet user with "Alice"
store result2 as greet user with "Bob" and "Hi" and "."
```

### List Comprehensions and Filtering

**Python:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# List comprehension
squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]

# Filtering
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

# Map and filter
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store numbers as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

// Mapping
store squares as []
for each x in numbers:
    add (x times x) to squares
end for

// Filtering
store even numbers as []
for each x in numbers:
    check if (x mod 2) is 0:
        add x to even numbers
    end check
end for

// Combined map and filter
store even squares as []
for each x in numbers:
    check if (x mod 2) is 0:
        add (x times x) to even squares
    end check
end for
```

### Classes and Inheritance

**Python:**
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
    
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, "Canine")
        self.breed = breed
    
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks!")
    
    def fetch(self):
        print(f"{self.name} fetches the ball!")
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
create container Animal:
    property name as Text
    property species as Text
    
    action speak:
        display name with " makes a sound"
    end action
end container

create container Dog extends Animal:
    property breed as Text
    
    action initialize:
        parameter name as Text
        parameter breed as Text
        
        store name as name
        store species as "Canine"
        store breed as breed
    end action
    
    action speak:
        display name with " barks!"
    end action
    
    action fetch:
        display name with " fetches the ball!"
    end action
end container
```

### Exception Handling

**Python:**
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Math error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
finally:
    print("Cleanup code here")
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
try:
    store result as 10 divided by 0
    display result
catch math error:
    display "Math error: " with math error.message
catch error:
    display "Unexpected error: " with error.message
finally:
    display "Cleanup code here"
end try
```

### Dictionary Operations

**Python:**
```python
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Access
print(user["name"])
print(user.get("country", "Unknown"))

# Update
user["age"] = 31
user.update({"country": "USA", "job": "Engineer"})

# Iterate
for key, value in user.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store user as {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

// Access
display user["name"]
display user["country"] or "Unknown"

// Update
store user["age"] as 31
store user["country"] as "USA"
store user["job"] as "Engineer"

// Iterate
for each key in user:
    display key with ": " with user[key]
end for
```

```

### Generics/Templates

**Java:**
```java
public class Stack<T> {
    private List<T> items = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void push(T item) {
        items.add(item);
    }
    
    public T pop() {
        if (items.isEmpty()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Stack is empty");
        }
        return items.remove(items.size() - 1);
    }
    
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return items.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
create container Stack:
    property items as List
    
    action initialize:
        store items as []
    end action
    
    action push:

            throw error "Stack is empty"
        end check
        
        return pop of items
    end action
    
    action is empty:
        return length of items is 0
    end action
end container
```

### Static Methods

**Java:**
```java
public class MathUtils {
    public static double calculateArea(double radius) {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;

        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

double area = MathUtils.calculateArea(5.0);
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
// WFL doesn't have static methods, but uses regular actions
define action called calculate area:
    parameter radius as Number
    store pi as 3.14159265359
    return pi times radius times radius
end action

define action called factorial:
    parameter n as Number
    
    check if n is less than or equal to 1:
        return 1
    end check
    
    return n times (factorial with (n minus 1))
end action

store area as calculate area with 5.0
```

### Pointers and Memory Management

**C++:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class Person {
private:
    std::string name;
    int age;
public:
    Person(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
    
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Stack allocation
    Person person1("Alice", 30);
    
    // Heap allocation (smart pointer)
    std::unique_ptr<Person> person2 = std::make_unique<Person>("Bob", 25);
    
    person1.display();
    person2->display();
    
    return 0;
}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
// WFL handles memory management automatically
create container Person:
    property name as Text
    property age as Number
    
    action initialize:
        parameter n as Text
        parameter a as Number
        store name as n
        store age as a
    end action
    
    action display:
        display "Name: " with name with ", Age: " with age
    end action
end container

// All objects are automatically managed
create new Person as person1:
    name is "Alice"
    age is 30
end

create new Person as person2:
    name is "Bob"
    age is 25
end

## From Ruby

### Blocks and Iterators

**Ruby:**
```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Each
numbers.each { |n| puts n }

# Select (filter)
evens = numbers.select { |n| n.even? }

# Map
squares = numbers.map { |n| n ** 2 }

# Reduce
sum = numbers.reduce(0) { |acc, n| acc + n }

puts "Evens: #{evens}"
puts "Squares: #{squares}"
puts "Sum: #{sum}"
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store numbers as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Each
for each n in numbers:
    display n
end for

// Select (filter)
store evens as []
for each n in numbers:
    check if (n mod 2) is 0:
        add n to evens
    end check
end for

// Map
store squares as []
for each n in numbers:
    add (n times n) to squares
end for

// Reduce
store sum as 0
for each n in numbers:
    store sum as sum plus n
end for

display "Evens: " with evens
display "Squares: " with squares
display "Sum: " with sum
```

### String Interpolation

**Ruby:**
```ruby
name = "Alice"
age = 30
greeting = "Hello #{name}, you are #{age} years old"
puts greeting

# Multi-line strings
message = <<~TEXT
  Dear #{name},
  
  Welcome to our service!
  You are #{age} years old.
  
  Best regards,
  The Team
TEXT

puts message
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store name as "Alice"
store age as 30
store greeting as "Hello " with name with ", you are " with age with " years old"
display greeting

// Multi-line strings
store message as "Dear " with name with ",

Welcome to our service!
You are " with age with " years old.

Best regards,
The Team"

display message
```

### Symbols and Hashes

**Ruby:**
```ruby
person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
}

puts person[:name]
puts person.fetch(:country, "Unknown")

person[:age] = 31
person[:country] = "USA"

person.each { |key, value| puts "#{key}: #{value}" }
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store person as {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

display person["name"]
display person["country"] or "Unknown"

store person["age"] as 31
store person["country"] as "USA"

for each key in person:
    display key with ": " with person[key]
end for
```

## Common Patterns Translation

### Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern

**Traditional (Java):**
```java
public class Database {
    private static Database instance;
    
    private Database() {}
    
    public static Database getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Database();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
// WFL handles this more naturally with module-level variables
store database instance as nothing

define action called get database:
    check if database instance is nothing:
        create new Database as database instance
    end check
    
    return database instance
end action
```

#### Observer Pattern

**Traditional (JavaScript):**
```javascript
class EventEmitter {
    constructor() {
        this.listeners = {};
    }
    
    on(event, callback) {
        if (!this.listeners[event]) {
            this.listeners[event] = [];
        }
        this.listeners[event].push(callback);
    }
    
    emit(event, data) {
        if (this.listeners[event]) {
            this.listeners[event].forEach(callback => callback(data));
        }
    }
}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
create container EventEmitter:
    property listeners as Object
    
    action initialize:
        store listeners as {}
    end action
    
    action on:
        parameter event as Text
        parameter callback as Function
        
        check if listeners[event] is undefined:
            store listeners[event] as []
        end check
        
        add callback to listeners[event]
    end action
    
    action emit:
        parameter event as Text
        parameter data as Any
        
        check if listeners[event] is not undefined:
            for each callback in listeners[event]:
                call callback with data
            end for
        end check
    end action
end container
```

### Functional Programming Concepts

#### Map, Filter, Reduce

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2);
const evens = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store numbers as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Map
store doubled as []
for each x in numbers:
    add (x times 2) to doubled
end for

// Filter
store evens as []
for each x in numbers:
    check if (x mod 2) is 0:
        add x to evens
    end check
end for

// Reduce
store sum as 0
for each x in numbers:
    store sum as sum plus x
end for
```

#### Higher-Order Functions

**Python:**
```python
def apply_operation(numbers, operation):
    return [operation(x) for x in numbers]

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

result = apply_operation([1, 2, 3, 4], square)
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
define action called apply operation:
    parameter numbers as List
    parameter operation as Function
    
    store result as []
    for each x in numbers:
        add (call operation with x) to result
    end for
    
    return result
end action

define action called square:
    parameter x as Number
    return x times x
end action

store result as apply operation with [1, 2, 3, 4] and square
```

## WFL Advantages

### Readability Benefits

**Traditional Code (Python):**
```python
def process_users(users, min_age, active_only=True):
    filtered = []
    for user in users:
        if user['age'] >= min_age and (not active_only or user['is_active']):
            filtered.append({
                'name': user['name'].title(),
                'email': user['email'].lower(),
                'age': user['age']
            })
    return filtered
```

**WFL Equivalent:**
```wfl
define action called process users:
    parameter users as List
    parameter min age as Number
    parameter active only as Boolean default yes
    
    store filtered as []
    
    for each user in users:
        store age check as user.age is greater than or equal to min age
        store active check as (active only is no) or (user.is active is yes)
        
        check if age check and active check:
            store processed user as {
                "name": format name with user.name,
                "email": tolowercase of user.email,
                "age": user.age
            }
            add processed user to filtered
        end check
    end for
    
    return filtered
end action
```

### Natural Error Messages

**Traditional Error:**
```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

**WFL Error:**
```
Cannot add number 5 and text "hello". 
Suggestion: Convert the text to a number first, or change the number to text.
```

### Self-Documenting Code

**Traditional:**
```javascript
if (user.createdAt < Date.now() - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) && !user.lastLogin) {
    sendEmail(user.email, "reactivation");
}
```

**WFL:**
```wfl
store thirty days ago as current time minus 30 days
store is old account as user.created at is less than thirty days ago
store never logged in as user.last login is nothing

check if is old account and never logged in:
    send email to user.email with "reactivation"
end check
```

## Migration Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple scripts and utilities
2. **Learn Patterns**: Focus on WFL equivalents of common patterns you use
3. **Leverage Strengths**: Use WFL's natural language for complex business logic
4. **Gradual Adoption**: Migrate projects incrementally

### Best Practices for Migration

#### 1. Identify Core Patterns
List the most common patterns in your current codebase:
- Data processing loops
- Conditional logic
- API calls
- Error handling
- Object creation and manipulation

#### 2. Create WFL Equivalents
For each pattern, create a WFL version and document the differences.

#### 3. Focus on Business Logic First
Start with the parts of your code that implement business rules, as these benefit most from WFL's readability.

#### 4. Use WFL's Strengths
- Complex conditional logic becomes more readable
- Error messages are more user-friendly
- Code reviews are easier with natural language syntax
- Documentation is often unnecessary due to self-describing code

### Common Migration Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Thinking in Symbols vs. Words
**Solution**: Practice translating small code snippets first

**Before (JavaScript):**
```javascript
if (x >= 0 && x <= 100 && y != null) {
    return x * 2;
}
```

**After (WFL):**
```wfl
check if x is greater than or equal to 0 and x is less than or equal to 100 and y is not nothing:
    return x times 2
end check
```

#### Challenge 2: Adjusting to `end` Statements
**Solution**: Use proper indentation and IDE support

**Tip**: Think of `end` statements as closing braces `}` but more descriptive.

#### Challenge 3: Natural Language Ambiguity
**Solution**: WFL's grammar is designed to be unambiguous

**Example:**
```wfl
// Clear and unambiguous
check if user age is greater than 18 and user status is "active":
    grant access
end check
```

### Migration Tools and Helpers

#### Code Converter Helper (Conceptual)
```wfl
define action called suggest migration:
    parameter original code as Text
    parameter source language as Text
    
    // This would be a sophisticated tool in practice
    display "Original " with source language with " code:"
    display original code
    display ""
    display "WFL equivalent (suggested):"
    
    // Pattern matching and conversion logic would go here
    
    display "Note: Review and test the converted code carefully"
end action
```

#### Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Variable names use natural language (spaces allowed)
- [ ] Complex conditions broken into readable parts
- [ ] Error handling includes helpful messages
- [ ] Functions (actions) have descriptive names
- [ ] Code reads like documentation
- [ ] Business logic is self-explanatory

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Week 1**: Basic syntax, variables, and simple operations
2. **Week 2**: Control flow, loops, and functions
3. **Week 3**: Containers (objects/classes) and data structures
4. **Week 4**: Async operations and error handling
5. **Week 5**: Advanced features and patterns
6. **Week 6+**: Real project migration

### Community and Resources

- Study existing WFL test programs in `TestPrograms/`
- Read the language specification in `Docs/language-reference/`
- Use the getting started guide for hands-on practice
- Leverage the cookbook for common task solutions

Remember: WFL's goal is to make programming more intuitive and accessible. If you find yourself writing complex or hard-to-read code, there's probably a more natural way to express it in WFL. Embrace the language's philosophy of clarity and natural expression!
