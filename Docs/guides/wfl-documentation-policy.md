Based on the guiding principles of the WebFirst Language (WFL) as outlined in Version 2 of the Project Statement, the documentation standard must reflect the language’s commitment to natural-language syntax, readability, clarity, and accessibility for developers of all experience levels. It should serve as an intuitive guide that bridges human communication and code, empowering beginners to start coding confidently while providing experienced developers with robust tools for advanced applications. Below is a comprehensive documentation standard tailored to WFL’s mission and principles.
WFL Documentation Standard
1. Purpose and Vision
The WFL documentation is designed to:

    Educate users by explaining language concepts in a clear, approachable manner.
    Empower developers to write readable, maintainable, and secure web applications.
    Engage a global community by encouraging collaboration and shared learning.

The documentation must embody WFL’s core values: simplicity, natural-language alignment, inclusivity, and a balance of power and accessibility. It should feel like a friendly mentor guiding users step-by-step, from their first lines of code to mastering complex features.
2. Documentation Structure
The documentation is organized into six key sections, each crafted to support a gradual learning curve and align with WFL’s principles:
2.1 Introduction

    Overview: Describe WFL, its mission to revolutionize web development, and how it differs from traditional languages.
    Key Features: Highlight natural-language syntax, minimal special characters, type safety, and built-in security.
    Example: Show a simple snippet like "Let the user's name be 'Alice'" to demonstrate intuitive coding.

2.2 Getting Started

    Setup Instructions: Provide clear, jargon-free steps to begin coding (e.g., "Open your web browser and visit wfl.example.com to use our online editor").
    First Program: Guide users through a basic example (e.g., "Say 'Hello, world!' to the screen").
    Resources: Introduce tools like the online playground and compiler, ensuring accessibility for beginners.

2.3 Language Basics

    Core Concepts: Explain fundamental elements using natural-language examples:
        Variables: "To store information, say 'Let the [name] be [value].' For example, 'Let the age be 25.'"
        Types: "WFL understands the kind of information automatically. 'Let the age be 25' makes age a number."
        Control Structures: "To make a decision, say 'If the age is greater than 18, then say 'You are an adult.''"
        Functions: "To repeat an action, create a task like 'To greet someone, say 'Hello, [their name]!'' Then use it with 'Greet the user.'"
    Errors: Include examples of clear, actionable error messages (e.g., "Expected a number but found text—try converting it first").

2.4 Advanced Features

    Complex Topics: Cover modern constructs in an accessible way:
        Async Operations: "To wait for something, say 'Wait for the server’s response, then show it to the user.'"
        Interoperability: "To use a JavaScript tool, say 'Use the JavaScript library called [name].' Then call its features naturally."
        Pattern Matching: "To check patterns, say 'Match the input: if it’s a number, say 'Got a number.''"
    Depth: Provide powerful options for experienced developers while keeping explanations clear.

2.5 Standard Library

    Built-in Tools: Document functions with natural-language names (e.g., "Get data from 'api/users'").
    Examples: Offer practical use cases for each function to show real-world relevance.

2.6 Best Practices

    Guidelines: Suggest ways to write clean, maintainable code (e.g., use descriptive names like "user’s age" instead of "x").
    Security: Explain how WFL’s features (e.g., automatic output escaping) enhance safety.
    Collaboration: Encourage sharing best practices within the community.

3. Documentation Format
To maximize usability and align with WFL’s web-focused nature, the documentation will be:

    Web-based: Hosted online with easy navigation, a search bar, and mobile-friendly design.
    Interactive: Feature an embedded playground for users to test code snippets in real time.
    Modular: Allow users to explore sections independently based on their needs.
    Versioned: Specify the WFL version and include a changelog for updates.

4. Writing Style and Tone
The documentation must reflect WFL’s accessibility goals:

    Friendly and Encouraging: Use a warm, conversational tone to welcome beginners.
    Simple Language: Avoid jargon (e.g., say "create a new thing" instead of "instantiate an object").
    Example-Rich: Pair every concept with a practical example.
    Inclusive: Use universal language, avoiding cultural references that might confuse non-native speakers.

5. Key Content Guidelines
The documentation must align with WFL’s 19 guiding principles:

    Natural-Language Syntax: Emphasize code that reads like English (e.g., "Add a button to the page").
    Minimize Special Characters: Show word-based alternatives (e.g., "plus" instead of "+") where possible, with optional intuitive symbols.
    Readability and Clarity: Prioritize clear intent (e.g., "Show the user’s name" vs. "print(name)").
    Clear Error Reporting: Demonstrate helpful error messages (e.g., "The value needs to be a number—check your input").
    Type Safety: Explain type inference (e.g., "Let price be 19.99" implies a number).
    Modern Features: Illustrate async tasks and pattern matching naturally.
    Interoperability: Detail integration with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (e.g., "Use the JavaScript library 'moment' to format dates").
    Security: Highlight protective features (e.g., "WFL escapes output to prevent attacks").
    Accessibility for Beginners: Use simple constructs (e.g., "Let name be 'Alice'").
    Expressiveness: Offer advanced tools (e.g., "The button is clickable and visible" defines properties).
    Balanced Simplicity and Power: Show both basic and sophisticated examples.
    Community: Invite contributions like tutorials or examples.
    Performance: Note optimizations (e.g., short-circuit evaluation) without burdening users.
    Standard Library: Document intuitive functions (e.g., "Fetch data from [url]").
    Scalability: Suggest modular structures for large projects.
    Gradual Learning: Start with basics and build to advanced topics.
    Error Transparency: Simplify debugging with clear feedback.
    Best Practices: Promote consistent, high-quality coding.
    Avoid Unnecessary Conventions: Omit traditional syntax like semicolons unless justified.

6. Community and Collaboration

    User Contributions: Include a section for community tutorials, examples, and extensions.
    Feedback: Offer a way to submit suggestions or report issues.
    Support: Link to forums or help channels for community interaction.

7. Accessibility Considerations

    Text Alternatives: Provide descriptions for visuals and code.
    Readability: Use high-contrast text and clear fonts.
    Navigation: Ensure keyboard-friendly access.
    Global Reach: Plan for translations or simplified versions.

8. Maintenance and Updates

    Reviews: Regularly update content to match WFL’s evolution.
    Changelog: Track changes to keep users informed.
    Feedback Integration: Refine based on user input.

Conclusion
The WFL documentation standard mirrors the language’s mission to make programming intuitive, inclusive, and powerful. By using natural language, prioritizing clarity, and offering interactive learning, it ensures developers can quickly adopt WFL for web development. This structured, community-driven approach fosters an ecosystem where creativity and collaboration thrive, aligning perfectly with WFL’s guiding principles.
