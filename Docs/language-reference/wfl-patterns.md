## Overview

The WFL pattern matching system uses declarative `create pattern` blocks that compile to an efficient bytecode virtual machine. This approach provides:

- **Natural language syntax** - Use words like "one or more", "optional", "between 1 and 5"
- **Type safety** - Capture groups are typed as `Option<Text>` with flow-sensitive analysis
- **Performance protection** - Built-in guards against catastrophic backtracking
- **Clear error messages** - Helpful diagnostics for both syntax and runtime errors
- **Full Unicode support** - Handle text in any language or script
- **Bytecode compilation** - Optimized execution through VM

## Basic Syntax

### Creating Patterns

```wfl
create pattern email_pattern:
    one or more letter or digit or "." or "_"
    "@"
    one or more letter or digit or "."
end pattern
```

### Using Patterns

```wfl
// Check if text matches a pattern
if "user@example.com" matches email_pattern:
    display "Valid email!"
end if

// Find matches and extract captures
store result as find email_pattern in "Contact: user@example.com"
if result is not nothing:
    display "Found email: " with result["match"]
end if

// Replace matches
store cleaned as replace email_pattern with "[EMAIL]" in "Send to user@example.com"

// Split text on pattern
store parts as split "one,two,three" on pattern comma_pattern
```

## Pattern Elements

### Character Classes

Character classes define what types of characters to match at a specific position:

| Pattern | What it matches | Example matches |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| `any letter` | Any uppercase or lowercase letter (A-Z, a-z) | "a", "B", "z", "Q" |
| `any digit` | Any numeric digit (0-9) | "0", "5", "9" |
| `any whitespace` | Spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns | " ", "\t", "\n" |
| `any punctuation` | Common punctuation marks | ".", "!", "?", ",", ";" |
| `any character` | Literally any single character | "a", "7", "@", " ", "â‚¬" |
| `letter` | Shorthand for `any letter` | "a", "Z" |
| `digit` | Shorthand for `any digit` | "0", "9" |
| `whitespace` | Shorthand for `any whitespace` | " ", "\t" |

**Combined Classes:**
```wfl
any letter or digit          // Alphanumeric
any letter or digit or "_"   // Variable names
any character not in "xyz"   // Exclusion
any character from "a" to "z" // Range
```

### Quantifiers

Control how many times elements can repeat:

| Pattern | What it means | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `zero or more` | Match 0 or unlimited times | `zero or more letters` |
| `one or more` | Match at least once | `one or more digits` |
| `optional` | Match 0 or 1 time | `optional whitespace` |
| `exactly N` | Match exactly N times | `exactly 3 digits` |
| `between N and M` | Match between N and M times | `between 2 and 4 letters` |
| `at least N` | Match N or more times | `at least 5 characters` |
| `at most N` | Match up to N times | `at most 10 digits` |

### Sequences and Alternatives

```wfl
// Sequence: patterns in order
"hello" then " " then "world"

// Alternatives: any of these patterns
"yes" or "no" or "maybe"

// Grouping with parentheses
("http" or "https") then "://"
```

### Anchors

Match at specific positions in text:

```wfl
at start of text     // Beginning of entire text
at end of text       // End of entire text
at start of line     // Beginning of line
at end of line       // End of line
word boundary        // Word boundaries
```

### Captures and Backreferences

Extract parts of matches and reference them later:

```wfl
// Named capture groups
create pattern name_pattern:
    capture {one or more letter} as "first_name"
    whitespace
    capture {one or more letter} as "last_name"
end pattern

// Backreferences - match same content
create pattern duplicate_word:
    capture {one or more letter} as "word"
    whitespace
    same as captured "word"
end pattern
```

### Lookarounds

Zero-width assertions that check ahead or behind:

```wfl
// Positive lookahead - must be followed by
digit followed by letter

// Negative lookahead - must NOT be followed by
digit not followed by letter

// Positive lookbehind - must be preceded by
digit preceded by "$"

// Negative lookbehind - must NOT be preceded by
digit not preceded by "$"
```

## Built-in Functions

### Pattern Operations

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `matches` | Check if text matches pattern | `if text matches email_pattern:` |
| `find` | Find first match with captures | `store result as find pattern in text` |
| `find_all` | Find all matches | `store all as find_all pattern in text` |
| `replace` | Replace matches | `store new as replace pattern with "X" in text` |
| `split` | Split by pattern | `store parts as split text on pattern delimiter` |

end pattern

create pattern mixed_japanese:
    unicode script "Hiragana" or "Katakana" or "Han"
end pattern
```

### International Examples

```wfl
// Japanese email pattern
create pattern japanese_email:
    one or more (unicode script "Hiragana" or "Katakana" or "Han" or letter or digit)
    "@"
    one or more (letter or digit or "." or "-")
    "."
    between 2 and 10 letter
end pattern

// Arabic phone number
create pattern arabic_phone:
    optional "+"
    optional unicode script "Arabic-Indic"  // Ù -Ù©
    exactly 3 (unicode script "Arabic-Indic" or digit)
    "-"
    exactly 7 (unicode script "Arabic-Indic" or digit)
end pattern
```

## Performance & Optimization

### Pattern Compilation and Caching

The WFL pattern engine automatically caches compiled patterns:

```wfl
// Patterns are compiled once and cached
for each email in email_list:
    if email matches email_pattern:  // Uses cached bytecode
        add email to valid_emails
    end if
end for each
```

### Optimization Guidelines

1. **Use specific patterns** rather than overly general ones
2. **Anchor patterns** when possible to reduce search space
3. **Use character classes** instead of long alternations
4. **Avoid nested quantifiers** that can cause backtracking
5. **Test with problematic inputs** to ensure performance

### Performance Protections

The WFL pattern engine includes:
- **Step counting** - Limits total matching operations
- **Recursion depth limits** - Prevents stack overflow
- **Backtracking guards** - Detects and prevents catastrophic backtracking
- **Memory pools** - Efficient memory management for captures

## Migration from Regex

### Conversion Guide

| PCRE Regex | WFL Pattern |
|------------|-------------|
| `\d+` | `one or more digit` |
| `\w*` | `zero or more letter or digit or "_"` |
| `[a-zA-Z]+` | `one or more letter` |
| `\s+` | `one or more whitespace` |
| `(pattern)` | `capture {pattern} as "name"` |
| `pattern?` | `optional pattern` |
| `pattern{2,5}` | `between 2 and 5 pattern` |
| `pattern1\|pattern2` | `pattern1 or pattern2` |
| `^pattern$` | `at start of text then pattern then at end of text` |
| `(?=\d)` | `followed by digit` |
| `(?<=\$)` | `preceded by "$"` |
| `(.+)\1` | `capture {one or more any character} as "x" then same as captured "x"` |

### Migration Strategy

1. **Start simple** - Convert basic character classes first
2. **Test incrementally** - Verify each pattern works correctly
3. **Use composition** - Build complex patterns from simple ones
4. **Leverage tools** - Use conversion utilities where available

## Design Philosophy

WFL's pattern system represents a fundamental reimagining of text pattern matching. Traditional regular expressions, while powerful, suffer from a terse, symbol-heavy syntax that makes them notoriously difficult to read and maintain.

### Why Natural Language Patterns?

1. **Readability Over Brevity**: While regex prioritizes compact notation, WFL patterns prioritize clarity. Compare `^\d{3}-[A-Za-z]{2}$` with "at start of text then exactly 3 digit then '-' then exactly 2 letter then at end of text" - the latter is instantly understandable.

2. **Self-Documenting Code**: WFL patterns serve as their own documentation. The pattern itself explains its purpose in plain English.

3. **Lower Barrier to Entry**: By using familiar words instead of cryptic symbols, WFL makes pattern matching accessible to beginners and non-programmers.

4. **Fewer Errors**: Natural language patterns eliminate common regex pitfalls like escaping issues, greedy vs. lazy quantifiers, and backreference confusion.

### Historical Context

WFL's pattern system draws inspiration from:
- **SNOBOL and Icon**: Languages that treated patterns as first-class objects
- **Raku (Perl 6)**: Introduced rules and grammars with more readable syntax
- **Parser Combinators**: Functional programming's composable parsers
- **Cucumber Expressions**: BDD tools using placeholders like `{int}` and `{string}`

### Implementation Architecture

WFL patterns compile to an efficient bytecode VM:

```
Pattern Source â†’ Lexer â†’ Parser â†’ AST â†’ Compiler â†’ Bytecode â†’ VM â†’ Results
```

The VM uses:
- NFA simulation with epsilon transitions
- Backtracking with safety limits
- Parallel thread execution for alternatives
- Efficient capture group tracking

## Best Practices

### Pattern Design
1. **Use descriptive names** - `email_pattern` not `pattern1`
2. **Break complex patterns into parts** - Compose smaller patterns
3. **Test edge cases** - Empty strings, malformed input, boundaries
4. **Document intent** - Add comments explaining what patterns match

### Error Handling
```wfl
store result as find pattern in text
if result is not nothing:
    // Always check captures exist before using
    if result["capture_name"] is not nothing:
        display result["capture_name"]
    end if
end if
```

### Performance
1. **Compile once, use many** - Let the engine cache patterns
2. **Profile hot patterns** - Measure and optimize frequently used patterns
3. **Use standard library** - Leverage pre-built, optimized patterns
4. **Avoid catastrophic backtracking** - Test with adversarial inputs

### Maintainability
1. **Version control patterns** - Track changes like code
2. **Use pattern composition** - Build from reusable components
3. **Add unit tests** - Test patterns with known inputs/outputs
4. **Keep patterns simple** - Favor clarity over cleverness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pattern doesn't match expected input:**
- Check for missing `optional` quantifiers
- Verify character classes match your data
- Test with simpler patterns first

**Captures are empty:**
- Ensure capture groups actually match content
- Check quantifiers allow expected matches
- Verify capture names are used consistently

**Performance issues:**
- Simplify complex alternations
- Reduce nested optional groups
- Use more specific patterns

**Type errors with captures:**
- Always check `is not nothing` before using
- Remember captures are `Option<Text>`
- Use flow-sensitive analysis to narrow types

### Error Messages

WFL provides clear, actionable error messages:

```wfl
// Syntax error
create pattern bad_range:
    between 5 and 2 digit  // Error: Invalid range
end pattern
// Error: PATTERN-SYNTAX-INVALID-RANGE
// Quantifier range must have min <= max

// Runtime protection
// Error: PATTERN-RUNTIME-DEPTH
// Pattern matching stopped to prevent infinite loops
```
