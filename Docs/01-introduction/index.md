# Introduction to WFL

Welcome to the WebFirst Language (WFL) documentation! WFL is a revolutionary programming language designed to make coding as natural as writing plain English.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll discover:

- **[What is WFL?](what-is-wfl.md)** - Learn about WFL's mission and core identity
- **[Key Features](key-features.md)** - Explore WFL's unique capabilities
- **[Natural Language Philosophy](natural-language-philosophy.md)** - Understand the 19 guiding principles
- **[First Look](first-look.md)** - See WFL code in action
- **[Why WFL?](why-wfl.md)** - Discover why WFL matters for your projects

## Quick Preview

Here's what WFL code looks like:

```wfl
store greeting as "Hello, World!"
display greeting

check if 5 is greater than 3:
    display "Math works!"
otherwise:
    display "Something is wrong!"
end check

count from 1 to 5:
    display "Counting: " with the current count
end count
```

Notice how readable that is? You can probably understand what it does without any prior programming knowledge. That's the power of WFL's natural language syntax.

## Who is WFL For?

WFL is designed for everyone:

- **Beginners** - Learn to code without cryptic syntax
- **Experienced Developers** - Write more maintainable code
- **Teams** - Collaborate with readable, self-documenting code
- **Educators** - Teach programming concepts clearly
