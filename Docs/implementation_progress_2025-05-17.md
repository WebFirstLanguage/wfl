# Implementation Progress - May 17, 2025

## Execution Logging System

Added comprehensive execution logging that traces all runtime actions when compiled in debug mode:

### New Features
- Added execution logging configuration option in `WflConfig` struct
  - Enabled by default in debug builds, disabled in production
  - Can be toggled via `.wflcfg` with `execution_logging = true/false`
  
- Created separate execution log file (`*_exec.log`) to capture detailed execution tracing
  - Log file is separate from the regular logging system to avoid cluttering the main log

- Implemented hierarchical execution logging with proper indentation
  - Added `IndentGuard` to automatically track and manage nesting levels
  - Visual representation of execution depth with indented log entries

- Added specialized logging macros for different execution events:
  - `exec_trace` - General execution tracing
  - `exec_var_declare` - Variable declarations
  - `exec_var_assign` - Variable assignments
  - `exec_expr_eval` - Expression evaluations
  - `exec_control_flow` - Control flow decisions
  - `exec_function_call` - Function calls with arguments
  - `exec_function_return` - Function returns with values
  - `exec_block_enter/exit` - Block entry and exit

- Implemented zero-overhead design for release builds:
  - All execution logging code is completely removed in release builds
  - Used conditional compilation with `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` to ensure no performance impact

### Files Modified
- `src/config.rs` - Added execution logging configuration option
- `src/logging.rs` - Implemented execution logging infrastructure
- `src/lib.rs` - Added global config and logger initialization
- `src/main.rs` - Updated to use execution logging in the main execution flow
- `src/interpreter/mod.rs` - Added instrumentation to log execution actions

### Documentation
- Created detailed documentation in `Docs/wfl-logging.md`
  - Explained configuration options
  - Provided sample log output
  - Documented best practices
  - Explained the differences between debug and release builds

## WFL Configuration Checker Tool

Added a new Python utility to verify configuration files (.wflcfg) across the project:

### New Features
- Created `wfl_config_checker.py` in the Tools directory:
  - Checks for existence of both global and local configuration files
  - Validates all settings for correctness
  - Generates detailed reports of issues found
  - Provides automatic fixing capabilities with `--fix` flag

- Implemented validation for all configuration settings:
  - Type checking for integer, boolean, and string values
  - Validation of acceptable values (e.g., log levels must be debug/info/warn/error)
  - Detection of unknown settings

- Added smart file discovery:
  - Recursively finds all `.wflcfg` files in project directories
  - Checks global configuration paths based on the current platform
  - Respects environment variable override for global config path

- Included auto-fixing functionality:
  - Can create missing config files with default settings
  - Corrects invalid settings to their default values
  - Preserves existing valid settings

### Files Added
- `Tools/wfl_config_checker.py` - New configuration validation tool

### Usage
```
python Tools/wfl_config_checker.py [--project-dir DIR] [--fix] [--verbose]
```

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Missing Macro Imports
- Fixed compilation errors related to missing macro imports in the execution logging system:
  - Added required macro imports to `src/interpreter/mod.rs`:
    ```rust
    use crate::exec_trace;
    use crate::exec_var_declare;
    use crate::exec_var_assign;
    use crate::exec_control_flow;
    use crate::exec_block_enter;
    use crate::exec_block_exit;
    use crate::exec_function_call;
    use crate::exec_function_return;
    ```
  - Added `exec_trace` import to `src/main.rs`:
    ```rust
    use wfl::{error, exec_trace, info};
    ```
  - Removed unused import `wfl::logging` from `src/main.rs`

- This ensures that all execution tracing macros are properly imported in the modules where they are used
- Project now compiles without errors or warnings
