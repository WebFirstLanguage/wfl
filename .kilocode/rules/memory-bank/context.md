# WFL Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The WFL team is currently focused on:

1. **Static Analyzer Improvements**:
   - Fixing issues with variable usage detection, particularly:
     - Variables used in action calls as arguments
     - Variables used in I/O operations
     - Parameters in action definitions used in wait/append statements
   - Improving unreachable code detection

2. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Addressing memory leaks in closures using weak references for parent environments
   - Optimizing parser memory allocations to reduce heap churn
   - Improving file I/O with append-mode operations instead of read-modify-write

3. **Nexus Test Suite Enhancement**:
   - Expanding the Nexus integration test suite to cover more language features
   - Ensuring comprehensive testing of asynchronous operations

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Implementation of configuration validation and auto-fix flags (`--configCheck` and `--configFix`)
   - Added in May 2025

## Recent Changes

### Parser Stability Enhancement (May 2025)
- Fixed critical infinite loop issue with comprehensive end token handling
- Enhanced error recovery with improved synchronization
- Resolved borrow checker issues with proper token lookahead
- Added comprehensive logging for better debugging

### Debug Output Refactoring
- All debug output now uses standardized `exec_trace!` macro
- Clean separation of program output from debug messages
- Memory optimization with adjusted thresholds
- Enhanced execution flow traceability

### Static Analyzer Fixes (May 2025)
- Fixed detection of unused variables in action definitions, I/O statements, and action calls
- Improved control flow graph generation for unreachable code detection
- Enhanced shadowing detection in nested scopes

### Build System Updates
- Support for cross-platform compilation
- Automated installers for Windows (MSI), Linux (deb/tar.gz), and macOS (pkg)
- Skip-if-unchanged logic to avoid unnecessary builds

## Current Challenges

1. **Async Operations**:
   - The `wait for ... and ...` construct currently executes sequentially
   - True concurrency is planned for a future release

2. **File I/O Edge Cases**:
   - The `open file` command creates files if they don't exist
   - A dedicated `create file` syntax is planned

## Next Steps

1. **Bytecode Compiler Implementation**:
   - Design and implement bytecode instructions
   - Add optimization passes
   - Implement constant folding and dead code elimination

2. **Virtual Machine Development**:
   - Design register-based VM
   - Implement JIT compilation support
   - Add performance optimizations

3. **Full Concurrency Support**:
   - Implement true parallel execution for `wait for ... and ...`
   - Add resource management for concurrent operations

4. **Enhanced File I/O API**:
   - Add dedicated `create file` syntax
   - Implement more granular file permissions and modes
