# WFL Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The WFL team is currently focused on:

1. **VSCode Extension Consolidation** (May 2025):
   - Merging two existing VSCode extension implementations (JavaScript and TypeScript)
   - Creating a robust TextMate grammar for WFL syntax highlighting
   - Implementing a dual-mode formatter that works both with and without WFL installed
   - Enhancing IDE integration through LSP client support
   - Building a seamless developer experience that adapts to available tools

2. **Static Analyzer Improvements**:
   - Fixing issues with variable usage detection, particularly:
     - Variables used in action calls as arguments
     - Variables used in I/O operations
     - Parameters in action definitions used in wait/append statements
   - Improving unreachable code detection

3. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Addressing memory leaks in closures using weak references for parent environments
   - Optimizing parser memory allocations to reduce heap churn
   - Improving file I/O with append-mode operations instead of read-modify-write

4. **Nexus Test Suite Enhancement**:
   - Expanding the Nexus integration test suite to cover more language features
   - Ensuring comprehensive testing of asynchronous operations

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Implementation of configuration validation and auto-fix flags (`--configCheck` and `--configFix`)
   - Added in May 2025

6. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Adapting the interpreter and static analyzer to work with existing WFL files
   - Ensuring language evolution doesn't break existing code
   - Improving error recovery mechanisms in the parser

## Backward Compatibility Commitment

The WFL team has established a key design principle: **The interpreter must adapt to work with existing WFL files, not the other way around**. This means:

1. Language changes and improvements should never require users to modify their existing WFL code
2. The parser, analyzer, type checker, and interpreter must all adapt to varying syntax patterns and usage styles
3. Diagnostic tools must work with existing code without requiring modifications
4. New features should introduce new capabilities without breaking backward compatibility
5. Error recovery mechanisms should be robust enough to handle unexpected or non-standard syntax

This principle has led to several recent improvements:
- Enhanced parser error recovery with better end token handling
- Updated static analyzer to correctly identify variable usage in all contexts
- Improved type checker to handle file handling and I/O operations consistently

## Recent Changes

### VSCode Extension Consolidation (May 2025)
- Designing a unified VSCode extension that merges existing JavaScript and TypeScript implementations
- Implementing a comprehensive TextMate grammar for WFL syntax highlighting
- Creating a dual-mode formatter that works both with and without WFL installed:
  - Built-in formatter for independent operation
  - WFL CLI-based formatter for enhanced operation
- Adding LSP client integration that gracefully handles WFL availability
- Improving developer experience with adaptive configuration options
- Preparing for publication to the VS Code Marketplace

### Parser Stability Enhancement (May 2025)
- Fixed critical infinite loop issue with comprehensive end token handling
- Enhanced error recovery with improved synchronization
- Resolved borrow checker issues with proper token lookahead
- Added comprehensive logging for better debugging

### Debug Output Refactoring
- All debug output now uses standardized `exec_trace!` macro
- Clean separation of program output from debug messages
- Memory optimization with adjusted thresholds
- Enhanced execution flow traceability

### Static Analyzer Fixes (May 2025)
- Fixed detection of unused variables in action definitions, I/O statements, and action calls
- Improved control flow graph generation for unreachable code detection
- Enhanced shadowing detection in nested scopes

### Build System Updates
- Support for cross-platform compilation
- Automated installers for Windows (MSI), Linux (deb/tar.gz), and macOS (pkg)
- Skip-if-unchanged logic to avoid unnecessary builds

## Current Challenges

1. **Async Operations**:
   - The `wait for ... and ...` construct currently executes sequentially
   - True concurrency is planned for a future release

2. **File I/O Edge Cases**:
   - The `open file` command creates files if they don't exist
   - A dedicated `create file` syntax is planned

## Next Steps

1. **VSCode Extension Release**:
   - Complete consolidation of the two extension implementations
   - Finalize TextMate grammar and formatter implementations
   - Publish to VS Code Marketplace
   - Create documentation and examples for users

2. **Bytecode Compiler Implementation**:
   - Design and implement bytecode instructions
   - Add optimization passes
   - Implement constant folding and dead code elimination

3. **Virtual Machine Development**:
   - Design register-based VM
   - Implement JIT compilation support
   - Add performance optimizations

4. **Full Concurrency Support**:
   - Implement true parallel execution for `wait for ... and ...`
   - Add resource management for concurrent operations

5. **Enhanced File I/O API**:
   - Add dedicated `create file` syntax
   - Implement more granular file permissions and modes
