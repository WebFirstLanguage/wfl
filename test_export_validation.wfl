# Test export constant validation

store new constant VALID_CONSTANT as "This is a constant"
store invalid_variable as "This is not a constant"

export constant VALID_CONSTANT  # This should work

# This should fail at runtime - trying to export a non-constant as constant
export constant invalid_variable
