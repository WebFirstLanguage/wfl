// Test various error scenarios

// 1. Modifying a constant with undefined value (should only show constant error)
store new constant PI as 3.14159
change PI to undefined_value

// 2. Using undefined variable in regular assignment (should show undefined error)
store regular_var as 10
change regular_var to another_undefined

// 3. Arithmetic on constant with undefined value (should only show constant error)
add unknown_number to PI
