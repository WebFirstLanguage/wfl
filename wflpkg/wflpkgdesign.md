# Designing a Package Manager for WFL

## Why WFL needs its own package manager

WFL is a young language built on **Rust** and compiled via **Cargo**. Currently developers build the compiler and tooling by cloning the source, running cargo build and using cargo run to test programs[\[1\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/Docs/guides/building.md#L5-L13). Distribution artifacts (MSI, .deb, .pkg) are created during nightly builds, but there is no standard mechanism for sharing and re‑using **WFL programs/libraries**[\[2\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/Docs/guides/building.md#L39-L45)[\[3\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md#L71-L77). Developers must copy .wfl files manually or commit them to a monorepo; this doesn’t scale for a community‑driven ecosystem.

Other language ecosystems show how a package manager accelerates adoption: Rust’s **cargo** not only builds the compiler but also resolves dependencies, runs tests and publishes crates. Node’s **npm** made JavaScript ubiquitous by creating a central registry and a simple npm install command. A WFL‑specific package manager should bring the same ease of use, while avoiding the pitfalls of tangled dependency trees and brittle versioning.

## Design goals (inspired by Cargo, but for WFL)

1. **Unified manifest file:** Each WFL package should have a WFL.toml (or wflpkg.toml) describing the package’s name, version, authors, description and dependencies. Cargo’s manifest file (Cargo.toml) and Rust’s version scheme provide a model we can borrow. WFL already uses a calendar‑based version scheme (YY.MM.BUILD) for releases[\[4\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/README.md#L349-L362); that scheme could be adopted for packages (e.g., 25.9.1).
2. **Dependency resolution and lock file:** A WFL.lock captures the exact versions of dependencies to guarantee reproducible builds. Without a lock file, it’s easy to get different results each time you run build or install on a CI server. Cargo’s Cargo.lock solves this problem elegantly, and WFL should adopt the same approach.
3. **Central registry:** Much like crates.io or npmjs.org, a registry (e.g., wflhub.com) would host published packages. The package manager (wflpkg) can search, download and publish packages to this registry. Support for multiple registries (official, private, local or Git) should be part of the design.
4. **CLI commands:** The tool should feel familiar to developers coming from Cargo. Suggested commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| wflpkg init | Initialize a new WFL package with a template src/main.wfl and a manifest file |
| wflpkg new &lt;name&gt; | Create a new package in a directory, similar to cargo new |
| wflpkg build | Build the package and all dependencies; uses the WFL compiler under the hood |
| wflpkg run | Run the current package’s main program |
| wflpkg test | Run tests (names ending with \_test.wfl) |
| wflpkg install &lt;package&gt; | Add a dependency to the manifest and install it |
| wflpkg update | Update dependencies within allowed version ranges |
| wflpkg publish | Publish the package to the registry |
| wflpkg search &lt;keywords&gt; | Search the registry |
| wflpkg login/logout | Authenticate to a registry |

These commands mirror Cargo’s ergonomics and hide most of the complexity from beginners. 5. **Workspace support:** Like Cargo’s workspaces, multiple WFL packages in the same repository should be able to share a single lock file and build together. This encourages modular monorepos without node_modules sprawl. 6. **Versioning and semver semantics:** Packages should follow either semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) or WFL’s calendar version scheme[\[4\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/README.md#L349-L362). Tools like wflpkg publish should enforce that increasing the major (or month) version only happens on breaking changes. Because WFL promises backward compatibility over at least a year[\[5\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/README.md#L461-L464), the package manager can warn if a new release might break that promise. 7. **Offline cache and deterministic builds:** Installed packages should be cached under ~/.wflpkg to avoid repeated downloads. The build process must be deterministic: the same source and lock file produce bit‑identical artifacts, just as Cargo ensures reproducible builds across CI machines[\[6\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/Docs/guides/building.md#L25-L35). 8. **Cross‑platform support:** The package manager must work on Windows, Linux and macOS, just like WFL’s existing installers[\[2\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/Docs/guides/building.md#L39-L45). Pre‑built binaries for each OS can be published as package artifacts to improve installation speed. 9. **Security and trust:** Every package in the registry should be checksummed and optionally signed. On installation, the manager verifies checksums and warns about known vulnerabilities. Over time, features like wflpkg audit can scan dependencies for outdated or risky packages. 10. **Human‑readable manifests:** WFL is all about natural‑language readability, but developers still need structured metadata. The WFL.toml file can mix conventional TOML sections (\[package\], \[dependencies\]) with optional description fields written in plain English. For example:

\[package\]  
name = "greeting"  
version = "25.9.1"  
authors = \["You"\]  
description = "Provides functions to say hello in multiple languages."  
<br/>\[dependencies\]  
text_utils = "25.8.\*" # any build of August 2025  
http = { version = "25.7.0", optional = true }

## High‑level architecture

┌────────────┐ ┌──────────┐  
│ wflpkg │──────▶│ Registry │  
└────┬───────┘ └───┬──────┘  
│ │  
┌───────────▼──────────┐ ┌───▼───────────┐  
│ Dependency resolver │ │ Package cache │  
└───────────┬──────────┘ └───────────────┘

│ WFL compiler│  
└─────────────┘

1. **CLI layer:** Parses commands (build, install, publish) and reads WFL.toml/WFL.lock.
2. **Dependency resolver:** Consults the registry, resolves version ranges and generates/updates the lock file. Implements a deterministic algorithm similar to Cargo’s resolver but simplified for WFL’s ecosystem.
3. **Package cache:** Stores downloaded packages; uses checksums to deduplicate. Caches compiled artifacts for faster wflpkg build.
4. **Compiler integration:** Invokes the existing WFL compiler (wfl) with the appropriate flags and src directory. The build command may call cargo build to compile the compiler itself[\[7\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md#L25-L35), but normal package compilation should only require the WFL binary.
5. **Registry:** Provides APIs for searching, downloading and publishing packages. Support for HTTP/HTTPS and local file registries; credentials stored securely.

## Avoiding common pitfalls

- **Dependency hell:** The manager must enforce a single version of each package within a build (no nested node_modules madness). This mirrors Cargo’s strategy of deduping dependencies and is possible because WFL packages are compiled ahead of time.
- **Global vs local install confusion:** All dependencies are project‑local and defined by the manifest. A separate command (wflpkg global install) could install command‑line tools, but library code always lives in ./wflpkg or the registry cache.
- **Opaque scripts:** Some package managers run arbitrary install scripts (npm) that can hide malware. WFL packages should be pure source code and optional build scripts written in WFL or declared in the manifest. External shell scripts require explicit user approval.
- **Version drift:** Without a lock file, team members can end up with different versions. WFL.lock ensures everyone uses the same dependencies until you intentionally update them.
- **Breaking changes:** Because WFL promises backward compatibility[\[5\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/README.md#L461-L464), the manager can add a wflpkg check command to lint your package and ensure you haven’t broken your API or language features.

## Recommended implementation plan

1. **Prototype CLI** – Build an initial wflpkg command in Rust. Reuse Cargo’s argument‑parsing crates (e.g., clap) and library crates like semver.
2. **Manifest and lock format** – Define the TOML schema for WFL.toml and WFL.lock. Write serialization/deserialization code and integrate version constraint parsing.
3. **Local package building** – Teach the CLI to locate src/\*.wfl, call the WFL compiler (wfl binary built with cargo build --release) and place compiled outputs in target/ (mirroring Cargo’s convention)[\[1\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/Docs/guides/building.md#L5-L13).
4. **Registry API and cache** – Implement a simple HTTP server and client for storing and retrieving packages. Use checksums and compress packages as .wflpkg archives. Support ~/.wflpkg/registry as a local cache.
5. **Publish and install** – Add authentication, packaging and publishing logic. Packages should include metadata, source code and optional compiled artifacts per OS[\[2\]](https://github.com/WebFirstLanguage/wfl/blob/f8873c5dbf26111dae83933fdb0ab186736b6eab/Docs/guides/building.md#L39-L45).
6. **Workspaces and features** – Extend the manifest spec to support workspaces, optional dependencies and feature flags. Provide meaningful error messages when features are misconfigured.
7. **Community feedback & polish** – Share the tool internally and iterate on ergonomics. Add commands like wflpkg doc to open documentation, or integrate with the LSP for auto‑completion of dependencies.

## Conclusion

A dedicated package manager will turn WFL from a neat toy into a sustainable ecosystem. By emulating Cargo’s strengths—manifest‑driven builds, lock files, workspaces and a central registry—while avoiding the chaos of other ecosystems, **wflpkg** can make sharing WFL code as easy as playing a K‑On! bass riff. Implemented thoughtfully, it will allow beginners to “jam” with community packages without drowning in dependency hell, and give advanced users the control and security they need to ship reliable WFL applications.
