// TDD Test: Multi-Server Resolution Bug
// This test MUST FAIL initially because server resolution is broken
// Following TDD approach - write failing test first
//
// SECURITY ISSUE: Multi-server operations always target first server instead of resolving by server ID
// LOCATION: src/interpreter/mod.rs:3174 - web_servers.iter().next() always gets first server
// EXPECTED FIX: Implement proper server ID tracking and resolution mechanism
