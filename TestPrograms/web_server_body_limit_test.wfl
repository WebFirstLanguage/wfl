// TDD Test: Web Server Body Size Limit DoS Vulnerability
// This test MUST FAIL initially because body size limits are not implemented
// Following TDD approach - write failing test first
//
// SECURITY ISSUE: HTTP request handlers lack body size limits, enabling memory exhaustion attacks
// LOCATION: src/interpreter/mod.rs:3033 - warp::body::bytes() without limits
// EXPECTED FIX: Add warp::body::content_length_limit(1_048_576) before .bytes() calls
