// This is a modified hello world program in WFL that works around the count issue

define action called main:
    display "Hello, World!"
end action

// Example of variable declaration and usage
store user name as "Alice"
display "Welcome, " with user name

// Example of conditional statement
check if user name is "Alice":
    display "Special greeting for Alice!"
otherwise:
    display "Hello, " with user name
end check

// Example of a loop with a workaround for the count issue
store loopcounter as 0
count from 1 to 5:
    store loopcounter as count
    display "Count: " with loopcounter
end count
