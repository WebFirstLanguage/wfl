// Test for container type checking features
// This test verifies that static member access and method type checking work correctly

// Define a container with static members and typed properties
create container Counter:
    static property count as 0
    property value: Number
    
    static action reset:
        store Counter count as 0
    end
    
    action increment:
        add 1 to value
    end
    
    action getValue returning Number:
        return value
    end
end

// Test static member access
display "Initial count: " with Counter count

// Create an instance
create new Counter as myCounter:
    value is 10
end

// Test method calls
myCounter.increment()
store result as myCounter.getValue()
display "Counter value: " with result

// Increment static count
store Counter count as Counter count + 1
display "Updated count: " with Counter count

// Test type errors (these should generate warnings but still run)
// The following lines will generate type errors during type checking:
// store text_value as "hello"
// myCounter.nonExistentMethod()  // Method doesn't exist
// NonExistentContainer count      // Container doesn't exist
