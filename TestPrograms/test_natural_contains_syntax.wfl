// Test natural 'contains' syntax
// These more natural forms should work after the parser fix

// Test 1: Natural contains syntax for strings
store filename as "test.rs"
store has_rust_ext as contains ".rs" in filename
display "Has .rs extension: " with has_rust_ext

// Test 2: Natural contains for checking substring
store text as "Hello, World!"
store has_hello as contains "Hello" in text
store has_goodbye as contains "Goodbye" in text
display "Has Hello: " with has_hello with ", Has Goodbye: " with has_goodbye

// Test 3: Natural contains for lists
store items as ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
store has_apple as contains "apple" in items
store has_grape as contains "grape" in items  
display "Has apple: " with has_apple with ", Has grape: " with has_grape

// Test 4: Contains in conditional
store path as "/usr/local/bin/program"
check if contains "/usr" in path:
    display "Path is in /usr directory"
end check

// Test 5: Multiple contains checks
store email as "user@example.com"
store valid_email as contains "@" in email and contains "." in email
display "Valid email format: " with valid_email

// Test 6: Contains with variable needle
store search_term as "test"
store mycontent as "This is a test string"
store myfound as contains search_term in mycontent
display "Found search term: " with myfound

// Also test that the old syntax still works for backward compatibility
store old_style as contains of filename and ".rs"
display "Old style contains still works: " with old_style

display "All natural contains syntax tests passed!"
