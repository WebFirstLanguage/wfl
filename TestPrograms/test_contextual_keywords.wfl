// Test that common words can be used as variable names
// These should all work after the parser fix

// Test 1: Using 'count' as a variable name
store count as 0
display "Count is: " with count

// Test 2: Using 'files' as a variable name  
store files as ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
display "Files list: " with files

// Test 3: Using 'extension' as a variable name
store extension as ".rs"
display "Extension is: " with extension

// Test 4: Using 'contains' as a variable name
store contains as "test string"
display "Contains variable: " with contains

// Test 5: Using 'pattern' as a variable name
store pattern as "[0-9]+"
display "Pattern is: " with pattern

// Test 6: Using 'list' as a variable name
store list as [1, 2, 3]
display "List variable: " with list

// Test 7: Using 'map' as a variable name
store map as "location map"
display "Map variable: " with map

// Test 8: Multiple contextual keywords in same scope
store count as 10
store files as []
store extension as ".wfl"
display "Count: " with count with ", Files: " with files with ", Extension: " with extension

// Test 9: Using contextual keywords in expressions
store total_count as count + 5
store file_extension as "file" with extension
display "Total: " with total_count with ", Full ext: " with file_extension

// Test 10: Keywords should still work in their keyword context
count from 1 to 3:
