// Test to trigger the specific arity bug
// Using builtin functions that should take 2+ arguments but typechecker thinks they take 1

store a as 5
store b as 10

// Test functions that are in builtins but incorrectly default to 1 argument
// This should show type checking errors, not runtime errors

// Try to use min function with 2 arguments
// According to bug report, this should fail with "Function expects 1 arguments, but 2 were provided"
