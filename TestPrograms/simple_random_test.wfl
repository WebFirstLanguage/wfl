// Simple Random Test

// Test random function
// Note: The random function is available at runtime but not recognized by the static analyzer
// This is why we get a warning about "Variable 'random' is not defined" but the code still runs
// The issue is that 'random' is a function, not a value, so when we use it directly with 'with',
// it displays "[NativeFunction]" instead of calling the function.

// The solution is to use the 'run' keyword which is designed to call functions
run random

// We can also use the direct function name in a display statement, but it will show [NativeFunction]
display "Random function: " with random
