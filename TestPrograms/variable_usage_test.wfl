// Regression test for variable usage detection in static analyzer
// This test verifies that the static analyzer correctly identifies variable usage in:
// 1. Action definition bodies with parameters used in I/O operations
// 2. Action calls where variables are passed as arguments
// 3. WaitForStatement with variables in write/append operations

// Create a log file for testing I/O operations
open file at "test_log.txt" as logfile

// Define test action with a parameter - tests that parameters in action definitions
// are correctly tracked when used within the action body
define action called test_action needs param_text:
    // Use the parameter in I/O context with concatenation - previously caused false positive warnings
    wait for append content param_text with "
" into logfile
end action

// Test case: Variable used in action call arguments - previously not tracked correctly
store message as "Hello from test"
test_action with message

// Test case: Variable used in WaitForStatement - previously not tracked in nested statements
store test_data as "Test data"
wait for write content test_data into logfile

// Close the file
close file logfile
