// Test program for basic type operations

// Variable declarations with type inference
store x as 10
store name as "Alice"
store is_active as yes

// Variable reassignment using supported syntax
store y as 20
change y to 25

// Basic operations with compatible types
store z as x plus 5
display "Result: " with z

// Simple action definition
define action called greet needs person_name:
    display "Hello, " with person_name
end action

// Correct function call
greet with "Bob"

// Another function call
greet with name

// Conditional with boolean checking
check if is_active:
    display "Active user: " with name
otherwise:
    display "Inactive user"
end check

// Simple boolean condition
store user_exists as yes
check if user_exists:
    display "User exists in system"
otherwise:
