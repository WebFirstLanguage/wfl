# WFL Implementation Progress - 2025-05-26

## Tasks Worked On:

-   **Investigated Static Analyzer Warning (ANALYZE-UNUSED):**
    -   **Issue:** A static analysis warning `ANALYZE-UNUSED` was reported for the `message_text` variable in the `log_message` action within `Nexus/nexus_dev.wfl`.
        ```wfl
        // Helper: Efficiently append a message line to the log file  
        define action called log_message needs message_text:
            // Use append mode for efficient logging - add the message with line ending
            wait for append content message_text with "
        " into logHandle
        end action
        ```
    -   **Initial Analysis:** Reviewed WFL documentation (`Docs/wfl-IO.md`, `Docs/wfl-vars.md`) and the `Nexus/nexus_dev.wfl` script. The usage of `message_text` in the `append content message_text with ...` construct appears to be a valid use of the variable, suggesting a potential false positive from the static analyzer.
    -   **Next Steps:** Plan to examine `src/analyzer/static_analyzer.rs` to understand how variable usage is tracked for I/O commands and to identify why this specific pattern might not be recognized.

## New Issues Identified:

-   Potential false positive in the static analyzer (`src/analyzer/static_analyzer.rs`) regarding variable usage in `append content ... with ...` constructs.

## Blockers:

-   None at the moment.

## Notes:

-   Created dev diary entry: `Dev diary/2025-05-26-fix-log-message-unused-var.md`.
-   The primary hypothesis is that the static analyzer needs adjustment to correctly recognize variable usage in this specific WFL I/O command pattern.

## Plan for Next Session:

-   Read `Docs/wfl-todo.md` and `Docs/implementation_progress_2025-05-24.md` for further context.
-   Dive into `src/analyzer/static_analyzer.rs` to diagnose and fix the unused variable detection.
-   Add regression tests.
-   Update `CHANGELOG.md` and other relevant documentation.
