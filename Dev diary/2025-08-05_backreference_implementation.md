# Dev Diary: Backreference Implementation
**Date**: August 5, 2025
**Author**: Claude
**Task**: Implement pattern backreferences for Phase 3 advanced features

## Summary
Successfully implemented backreference support in the WFL pattern matching system, allowing patterns to reference previously captured groups using the syntax `same as captured "name"`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. AST Extension
Added `Backreference(String)` variant to `PatternExpression` enum in `src/parser/ast.rs`:
```rust
pub enum PatternExpression {
    // ... existing variants ...
    Backreference(String), // References a named capture group
}
```

### 2. Bytecode Instruction
Added `Backreference(usize)` instruction to `src/pattern/instruction.rs`:
```rust
pub enum Instruction {
    // ... existing instructions ...
    /// Match a backreference to a previously captured group
    Backreference(usize), // capture group index
}
```

### 3. Parser Updates
- Added `KeywordSame` and `KeywordCaptured` tokens to the lexer
- Updated `parse_pattern_element` to recognize `same as captured "name"` syntax
- Fixed pattern concatenation to properly handle space-separated pattern elements
- Removed need for "followed by" connectors - patterns now use simple space separation

### 4. Compiler Updates
Added `compile_backreference` method to resolve capture names to indices:
```rust
fn compile_backreference(&mut self, name: &str) -> Result<(), PatternError> {
    if let Some(&capture_index) = self.capture_map.get(name) {
        self.program.push(Instruction::Backreference(capture_index));
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err(PatternError::CompileError(
            format!("Backreference to undefined capture group: '{}'", name)
        ))
    }
}
```

### 5. VM Implementation
Enhanced the VM to handle backreferences by:
- Storing captured text during execution
- Matching backreference against previously captured content
- Properly handling capture state in `VMState`
- Fixed `StepResult::Match` to include state for capture extraction

### 6. Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test program `TestPrograms/pattern_backreference_test.wfl` covering:
- Simple backreference matching (e.g., "aa" matches `capture {any letter} as word same as captured "word"`)
- Word repetition detection
- HTML/XML tag matching
- Multiple captures with backreferences
- Backreferences in quantified patterns

## Challenges and Solutions

### Pattern Syntax
**Challenge**: Initial attempt to use "followed by" as a connector caused parsing errors.
**Solution**: Simplified to space-separated pattern elements, consistent with existing pattern syntax.

### Capture API
**Challenge**: VM wasn't returning capture information with matches.
**Solution**: Updated `StepResult::Match` to include the final VM state, enabling capture extraction.

## Results
All backreference tests pass successfully:
- ✓ Simple character repetition
- ✓ Word repetition detection
- ✓ HTML tag matching with backreferences
- ✓ Multiple captures and backreferences
- ✓ Quoted string matching with backreferences

## Backward Compatibility
Verified that existing pattern tests continue to work correctly. The new feature integrates seamlessly with the existing pattern system without breaking changes.

## Next Steps
- Implement lookarounds (positive/negative lookaheads and lookbehinds)
- Add Unicode support for pattern matching
- Update documentation with new pattern syntax
