### Goal  
Fix semantic analyzer errors related to action parameters in Nexus/test.wfl.

### Approach  
The static analyzer was incorrectly flagging action parameters as undefined variables. This was happening because:

1. Action parameters were represented in the AST as space-separated names in a single parameter (e.g., "label expected actual").
2. The analyzer wasn't properly recognizing these parameters when they were used in the action body.

Instead of requiring users to modify their code, we adapted the analyzer to handle the existing code correctly, following the backward compatibility principle: "The interpreter must adapt to work with existing WFL files, not the other way around."

Our solution:
1. Modified the static analyzer to collect all action parameters by splitting space-separated parameter names.
2. Added a filter to skip errors about undefined variables that are actually action parameters.

This approach ensures that the analyzer correctly handles action parameters without requiring any changes to existing WFL code.

### Gotchas  
- Action parameters in WFL can be space-separated in a single parameter definition (e.g., "label expected actual").
- The analyzer needs to handle these parameters specially to avoid false positive errors.
- This fix is part of the "Static Analyzer Improvements" mentioned in the memory bank context, specifically addressing "parameters in action definitions used in wait/append statements."

### Outcome  
The analyzer now correctly handles action parameters and no longer reports false positive errors for them. This improves the developer experience by reducing noise in the error output and allowing the analyzer to focus on actual issues.
