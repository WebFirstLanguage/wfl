## Lookaround Implementation for WFL Pattern System

### Overview
Today I implemented lookaround support for the WFL pattern matching system. This includes positive/negative lookaheads and lookbehinds, allowing patterns to assert conditions about surrounding text without consuming characters.

### Syntax Design
The natural language syntax for lookarounds:
- Positive lookahead: `check ahead for {pattern}`
- Negative lookahead: `check not ahead for {pattern}`
- Positive lookbehind: `check behind for {pattern}`
- Negative lookbehind: `check not behind for {pattern}`

Example:
```wfl
create pattern digit_before_letter:
    digit check ahead for {letter}
end pattern
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. AST Extensions (src/parser/ast.rs)
Added four new variants to `PatternExpression`:
- `Lookahead(Box<PatternExpression>)`
- `NegativeLookahead(Box<PatternExpression>)`
- `Lookbehind(Box<PatternExpression>)`
- `NegativeLookbehind(Box<PatternExpression>)`

#### 2. Lexer Updates (src/lexer/token.rs)
Added new keywords:
- `KeywordAhead`
- `KeywordBehind`

#### 3. Parser Updates (src/parser/mod.rs)
Added parsing logic in `parse_pattern_element` to handle:
- `check [not] ahead for {pattern}`
- `check [not] behind for {pattern}`

The parser correctly handles nested patterns within braces and tracks whether the lookaround is negative.

#### 4. Bytecode Instructions (src/pattern/instruction.rs)
Added new instructions:
- `BeginLookahead` / `EndLookahead`
- `BeginNegativeLookahead` / `EndNegativeLookahead`
- `CheckLookbehind(usize)` / `CheckNegativeLookbehind(usize)`

Lookbehinds are simplified to require fixed-length patterns (stored as usize).

#### 5. Compiler Updates (src/pattern/compiler.rs)
Implemented compilation methods:
- `compile_lookahead`: Wraps pattern with Begin/End instructions
- `compile_negative_lookahead`: Similar but for negative assertions
- `compile_lookbehind`: Validates fixed length and generates CheckLookbehind
- `compile_negative_lookbehind`: Similar for negative lookbehinds
- `calculate_pattern_length`: Helper to determine if a pattern has fixed length

#### 6. VM Implementation (src/pattern/vm.rs)
The VM handles lookarounds by:
- **Lookaheads**: Save position, execute nested pattern, restore position on success
- **Negative lookaheads**: Save position, ensure pattern fails, restore position
- **Lookbehinds**: Currently simplified - only check if enough characters exist behind

The implementation uses a state-based approach with proper handling of nested lookarounds through depth tracking.

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Ownership in VM**: The `step` function takes ownership of VMState, requiring careful management of cloned states for lookaround evaluation.

2. **Nested Pattern Execution**: Lookarounds contain nested patterns that must be executed without affecting the main match position.

3. **WFL Syntax Issues**: The test programs revealed that WFL's property access syntax and function call syntax need clarification. Pattern functions aren't properly exposed in the standard library.

### Testing
Created test programs to verify lookaround functionality:
- `pattern_lookaround_expr_test.wfl`: Tests basic lookahead with pattern matching expressions
- Results show positive lookahead working correctly ("5a" matches `digit check ahead for {letter}`)

### Current Status
- ✅ AST nodes for all lookaround types
- ✅ Parser support for natural language syntax
- ✅ Bytecode instructions defined
- ✅ Compiler generates correct bytecode
- ✅ VM executes positive lookaheads correctly
- ⚠️  Negative lookahead may have issues (test showing incorrect behavior)
- ⚠️  Lookbehinds are simplified placeholders
- ⚠️  Integration with WFL standard library needs work

### Next Steps
1. Debug negative lookahead implementation in VM
2. Implement full lookbehind support with sub-pattern execution
3. Fix standard library integration for pattern functions
4. Add more comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation with lookaround examples

### Code Quality
- All code compiles without errors
- Minor warnings about unused variables addressed
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing pattern tests
