## Full Lookbehind Implementation

### Summary
Successfully implemented full lookbehind support with sub-pattern execution for WFL pattern matching. This completes the lookbehind portion of Phase 3 advanced pattern matching features.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Instruction Enum
Modified `src/pattern/instruction.rs` to change lookbehind instructions from simple length-based checks to full sub-program execution:
```rust
// Before:
CheckLookbehind(usize), // length only
CheckNegativeLookbehind(usize), // length only

// After:
CheckLookbehind(Box<Program>), // full sub-program
CheckNegativeLookbehind(Box<Program>), // full sub-program
```

#### 2. Updated Compiler
Modified `src/pattern/compiler.rs` to compile lookbehind patterns into sub-programs:
- Removed the fixed-length requirement
- Each lookbehind pattern is compiled into a complete Program
- The sub-program is embedded in the instruction

#### 3. VM Implementation
Completely rewrote lookbehind execution in `src/pattern/vm.rs`:
- Uses sub-VM approach similar to lookaheads
- Tries matching at different positions before current position
- Supports variable-length lookbehinds (up to 1000 characters)
- Ensures the pattern matches ending exactly at current position

### Technical Details

The implementation works by:
1. Creating a sub-VM for the lookbehind pattern
2. Trying different starting positions before the current position
3. For each position, extracting a substring and checking if the pattern matches the entire substring
4. Success if any position results in a complete match ending at current position

### Test Results
Created comprehensive test program `TestPrograms/pattern_lookbehind_test.wfl`:
- ✅ Positive lookbehind for literal patterns
- ✅ Negative lookbehind for word boundaries
- ✅ Complex lookbehinds with lookaheads
- ✅ Variable-length lookbehinds
- ✅ Lookbehinds at string boundaries

### Known Behavior
The pattern `check not behind for {"the "}` when applied to "the cat" matches "t" at position 0, not "cat". This is correct behavior because:
- "t" is not preceded by "the " (nothing precedes it)
- "h" is preceded by "t", not "the "
- "e" is preceded by "th", not "the "
- "c" is preceded by "the ", so it doesn't match

### Performance Considerations
- Limited lookback distance to 1000 characters to prevent excessive computation
- Each lookbehind requires trying multiple starting positions
- Could be optimized for fixed-length patterns in the future

### Next Steps
- Implement Unicode support for character classes
- Update documentation with lookbehind syntax and examples
- Consider optimizations for common lookbehind patterns
