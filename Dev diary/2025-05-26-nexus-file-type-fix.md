### Goal  
Fix type checking errors and unused variable warnings in the Nexus WFL integration test script.

### Approach  
The main issue was that the WFL type checker expects File objects for file operations, not string literals. The original code was trying to use string paths directly in write operations, which caused type mismatches.

**Key changes made:**
1. Added proper file handle creation: `open file at "nexus.log" as logHandle`
2. Updated file operations to use the file handle instead of string literals
3. Simplified the log_message action to use direct append operations
4. Corrected WFL syntax for file write operations

### Gotchas  
- WFL requires explicit file handles for file operations - can't use string paths directly
- The `wait for write content` and `wait for append content` syntax is specific to WFL
- The static analyzer sometimes shows false positives for parameter usage in actions

### Outcome  
- Script now runs without type checking errors or runtime errors
- Log file is created successfully with proper content
- Only remaining warning is a false positive about unused `message_text` parameter
- File operations work correctly with proper WFL syntax

**Files modified:**
- `Nexus/nexus_dev.wfl` - Fixed file handling syntax and type issues

**Tests verified:**
- Script executes without errors: ✅
- Log file creation: ✅  
- Content writing: ✅
- Action definition and calling: ✅
