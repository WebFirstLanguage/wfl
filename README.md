## Recent Major Improvements (May 2025)

### Parser Stability Enhancement
- **Fixed critical infinite loop issue**: Comprehensive end token handling for all constructs (`end action`, `end check`, `end for`, `end count`, etc.)
- **Enhanced error recovery**: Improved synchronization and orphaned token consumption
- **Resolved borrow checker issues**: Stable compilation with proper token lookahead
- **Added comprehensive logging**: Better debugging and execution tracing

### Debug Output Refactoring
- **Standardized logging system**: All debug output now uses `exec_trace!` macro
- **Clean separation**: Program output no longer polluted by debug messages
- **Memory optimization**: Adjusted thresholds while maintaining efficiency
- **Enhanced traceability**: Improved execution flow analysis

## Current Capabilities

WFL now supports:

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Full async/await support with Tokio runtime
- **Network Operations**: HTTP requests with Reqwest integration
- **Database Access**: SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL support via SQLx
- **File I/O**: Comprehensive file operations with async support
- **Natural Language Syntax**: English-like constructs for improved readability
- **Type Safety**: Static type checking with intelligent type inference
- **Error Handling**: Try/when/otherwise constructs for graceful error management
- **Real-time Development**: LSP server provides instant feedback in editors

## Current Limitations

- The `wait for ... and ...` construct executes sequentially (true concurrency planned for future release)
- The `open file` command creates the file if it doesn't exist (dedicated `create file` syntax planned)

## Execution Pipeline

All runs are type-checked and semantically analyzed by default. This ensures that scripts are validated for semantic correctness and type safety before execution, preventing many common runtime errors.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project is developed with the assistance of AI:

- **Devin.ai**: Primary AI developer responsible for core implementation
- **ChatGPT (GPT-o3)**: Assisted with code reviews and optimization
- **Claude (via Cline)**: Assisted with documentation and architectural design
- **Grok**: Indirectly contributed to the project through knowledge base

The combination of AI assistance with human oversight has allowed for rapid development while maintaining high code quality and documentation standards.

## Error Reporting and Diagnostics

WebFirst Language includes a comprehensive error reporting system that provides clear, actionable error messages to help developers quickly identify and fix issues:

- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Inspired by Elm's approach to error messages, using codespan-reporting for professional formatting
- **Source Context**: Error messages include the relevant source code snippets with precise highlighting
- **Actionable Suggestions**: For common errors, WebFirst Language suggests specific fixes and corrections
- **Unified Error System**: Consistent error formatting across all error types (syntax, semantic, type, runtime)
- **Contextual Hints**: Special handling for common mistakes like missing keywords in variable declarations
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Standardized exec_trace! macro for consistent debug output

## Code Quality Suite

WebFirst Language includes a built-in code quality suite with three main components:

### Linter (`--lint`)

The linter checks your code for style issues and best practices:

```bash
wfl --lint your_script.wfl
```

It enforces:
- Naming conventions (snake_case for variables and actions)
- 4-space indentation
- Consistent keyword casing (lowercase)
- No trailing whitespace
- Line length limits (default: 100 characters)
- Nesting depth limits (default: 5 levels)

### Static Analyzer (`--analyze`)

The static analyzer performs deeper code analysis:

```bash
wfl --analyze your_script.wfl
```

It detects:
- Unused variables and actions
- Unreachable code and dead branches
- Variable shadowing
- Inconsistent return paths

### Code Fixer (`--fix`)

The code fixer automatically formats your code and performs safe refactorings:

```bash
# Print fixed code to stdout
wfl --fix your_script.wfl

# Overwrite the file with fixed code
wfl --fix your_script.wfl --in-place

# Show a diff of the changes
wfl --fix your_script.wfl --diff
```

The fixer performs the following operations:
- Pretty-prints the code with consistent formatting
- Renames identifiers to follow snake_case convention
- Removes dead code
- Simplifies boolean expressions

#### Recent Improvements

- Fixed linter CLI behavior to allow `--lint --fix` combination
- Removed unconditional linter run during normal execution
- Updated CLI help text to reflect new flag behavior
- Added support for combined flags (e.g., `--lint --fix --diff`)
- Improved reporting methods for better fixer summaries

## Logging and Debugging

WFL includes structured logging and automatic debug report generation to help with troubleshooting.

### Enhanced Logging System

- **Standardized Debug Output**: All debug messages use the `exec_trace!` macro
- **Clean Separation**: Program output is separate from debugging information
- **Centralized Control**: Debug verbosity controlled through configuration
- **Memory Optimized**: Efficient logging with minimal overhead

### Configuration

These features can be configured in a `.wflcfg` file in the same directory as your script:

```
# Enable structured logging (default: false)
logging_enabled = true

# Set log level: debug, info, warn, error (default: info)
log_level = debug

# Enable automatic debug reports on errors (default: true)
debug_report_enabled = true

# Set execution timeout in seconds (default: 60)
timeout_seconds = 120

# Code quality settings
max_line_length = 100
max_nesting_depth = 5
indent_size = 4
snake_case_variables = true
trailing_whitespace = false
consistent_keyword_case = true
```

### Configuration Validation

WFL provides tools to validate and fix configuration files:

```bash
# Check configuration files for issues
wfl --configCheck

# Check and automatically fix configuration issues
wfl --configFix
```

These commands validate `.wflcfg` files against expected settings and types. The `--configCheck` flag reports issues without making changes, while `--configFix` attempts to automatically correct problems.

Configuration files are searched in the following order:
1. Global configuration (environment variable `WFL_GLOBAL_CONFIG_PATH` or platform default)
   - Linux/macOS: `/etc/wfl/wfl.cfg`
   - Windows: `C:\wfl\config`
2. Local configuration (`.wflcfg` in the current directory)

Local settings override global ones for overlapping keys.

### Logging

When enabled, logs are written to both the console (info level and above) and to a `wfl.log` file (all levels).
Each log entry includes a timestamp, message, source location, and elapsed time.

### Debug Reports

When a runtime error occurs, WFL automatically generates a `<script>_debug.txt` file containing:
- Error summary
- Stack trace
- Source code around the error
- Full action body (if inside an action)
- Local variables at the time of the error

This makes it easier to diagnose and fix issues in your WFL scripts.

## Editor Integration

### Language Server Protocol (LSP)

WFL includes a fully functional LSP server (`wfl-lsp`) that provides:

- **Real-time Diagnostics**: Errors and warnings as you type
- **Auto-completion**: Context-aware suggestions for keywords, variables, and functions
- **Go-to Definition**: Navigate to symbol definitions
- **Hover Information**: Type and documentation information on hover
- **Symbol Search**: Find symbols across the project
