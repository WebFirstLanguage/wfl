# WFL VSCode Extension Implementation Notes

## Completed Components

1. **Enhanced TextMate Grammar** (`syntaxes/wfl.tmLanguage.json`)
   - Comprehensive token definitions for WFL language constructs
   - Support for block structures and nesting
   - Proper scoping for all language elements

2. **Language Configuration** (`language-configuration.json`)
   - Bracket matching and auto-closing
   - Comment toggling
   - Indentation rules for WFL's indentation-based syntax
   - Word pattern definition
   - Code folding markers

3. **Independent Formatter** (`src/formatting/base-formatter.ts`)
   - Works without WFL installed
   - Handles indentation and code structure
   - Formats operators and keywords with proper spacing

4. **WFL CLI-based Formatter** (`src/formatting/wfl-formatter.ts`)
   - Integration with WFL's native `--lint --fix` command
   - Temporary file handling for unsaved documents
   - Proper error handling and output parsing

5. **Main Extension Module** (`src/extension.ts`)
   - WFL CLI and LSP detection
   - Feature adaptation based on WFL availability
   - Registration of commands and formatters
   - LSP client integration

6. **Extension Manifest** (`package.json`)
   - Configuration options for formatting and integration
   - Command definitions
   - Language contribution
   - Grammar registration

7. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with features and usage instructions
   - Implementation notes (this document)

## Current Issues and Fixes

We've addressed several TypeScript errors and implementation issues:

1. **Fixed Import Issues**
   - Removed unused imports (path, fs, semver in extension.ts)
   - Used proper import syntax for Mocha in test files
   - Fixed cp import in runTest.ts

2. **Function Parameter Handling**
   - Added underscores to unused parameters in formatting providers
   - Fixed parameter type annotations

3. **LSP Client Integration**
   - Fixed client.start() returning a Promise instead of Disposable
   - Wrapped Promise in a Disposable object

4. **Type Definitions**
   - Updated type annotations throughout the codebase

## Known External Issues

1. **Node Module Type Conflicts**
   - The lru-cache package has TypeScript definition issues
   - These are external dependency issues that would be fixed when running `npm install` with compatible versions
   - Not critical for the implementation logic itself

## Build and Test Setup

1. **Installation and Setup**
   ```bash
   cd vscode-extension
   npm install
   ```

2. **Fixing Remaining TypeScript Errors**
   - After npm install, most type errors from external modules should be resolved
   - If any remain, consider adding appropriate `@types/*` packages or adjusting version constraints

3. **Testing the Extension**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   npm test
   ```
   
4. **Debugging the Extension**
   - Open the vscode-extension folder in VS Code
   - Press F5 to launch a new window with the extension loaded
   - Open a .wfl file to test syntax highlighting and formatting

## Suggestions for Production Implementation

1. **Diff Parsing Enhancement**
   - Replace the simple diff parser with a more robust implementation
   - Consider using a library like 'diff' or 'diff-match-patch'

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add more specific error types and handling
   - Provide more descriptive error messages to users

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for formatter results
   - Implement throttling for formatting on type
   - Consider lazy-loading components

4. **Testing Enhancement**
   - Add more comprehensive unit tests
   - Add integration tests for formatters
   - Test with various WFL file structures

5. **Localization**
   - Add support for multiple languages in UI messages

6. **Telemetry**
   - Add optional telemetry for usage tracking
   - Respect VS Code's telemetry settings

## Design Decisions and Rationale

1. **Dual Formatter Approach**
   - Built-in formatter guarantees basic functionality even without WFL
   - WFL-based formatter provides enhanced formatting when available
   - Auto-detection allows seamless switching between modes

2. **LSP Integration**
   - Loose coupling with LSP allows the extension to function without it
   - Full LSP features are enabled when available
   - Clear user feedback about available functionality

3. **Configuration Options**
   - Granular control over formatting behavior
   - Options to override auto-detection when needed
   - Sensible defaults for most users

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when features are unavailable
   - Clear error messages to guide troubleshooting
   - Silent recovery from non-critical errors

## Next Steps for Release

1. **Create a Release Build**
   ```bash
   npm run vscode:prepublish
   vsce package
   ```

2. **Testing the Packaged Extension**
   - Install the VSIX file in VS Code
   - Verify all features work correctly
   - Test with and without WFL installed

3. **Publish to VS Code Marketplace**
   - Create publisher account if needed
   - Publish using `vsce publish`
   - Update metadata and images as needed

These notes should guide the final implementation and release process for the WFL VSCode extension.
