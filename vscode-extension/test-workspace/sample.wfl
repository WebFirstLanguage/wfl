// Sample WFL program for testing
store greeting as "Hello, World!"
store number as 42

// Display the greeting
display greeting

// Simple arithmetic
store result as number + 8
display "The result is: " with result

// Conditional logic
if result is greater than 50 then
  display "Result is large"
otherwise
  display "Result is small"
end if

// Loop example
count from i as 1 to 3
  display "Count: " with i
end count
