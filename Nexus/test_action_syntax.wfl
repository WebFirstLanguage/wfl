// Test multi-parameter action syntax

define action called add_numbers with parameters a and b:
    give back a plus b
end action

// Try calling with 'of' instead of 'with'
store result as add_numbers of 10 and 20
display "Result: " with result

// Try calling with 'with' using parentheses for each arg
store result2 as add_numbers with (10) and (20)
display "Result2: " with result2
