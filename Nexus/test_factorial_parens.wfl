// Test factorial with parentheses to control precedence

define action called factorial needs n:
    check if n is equal to 0:
        give back 1
    otherwise:
        // Recursive call with explicit parentheses
        give back n times (factorial with (n minus 1))
    end check
end action

display "Testing factorial(5) with explicit parentheses..."
store result as factorial with 5
display "Result: " with result
