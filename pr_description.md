# Debug Output Refactoring PR

## Summary

This PR refactors the debug output system in the WFL interpreter and parser to ensure all debug messages go through the logging system rather than directly to stdout. It standardizes the use of `exec_trace!` macros throughout the codebase, ensuring clean separation between program output and debugging information.

## Changes

- Replaced all direct `println!("DEBUG: ...")` statements with `exec_trace!` macros
- Added missing `use crate::exec_trace;` import to the parser module
- Fixed 12+ instances of debug output in the parser module
- Fixed 7+ instances of debug output in the interpreter module
- Updated documentation to reflect the changes
- Modified test.wfl to accommodate static analyzer limitations

## Testing

- Ran test.wfl script to verify the fixes work as expected
- Confirmed proper execution without debug messages in console output
- Verified log messages are correctly appended to nexus.log file
- Checked the AST dump to confirm concatenation expressions are properly parsed

## Related Issues

This PR completes the work started in the previous PR where we began standardizing the logging approach across the codebase. It also enhances our fix for the concatenation vs. action call parsing issue.

## Known Limitations

- The static analyzer doesn't recognize variable usage inside `WaitForStatement` structures, resulting in false positive "unused variable" warnings
- Future enhancement could include updating the static analyzer to inspect the inner statement of `WaitForStatement` nodes for variable usage

## Documentation

- Added implementation_progress_2025-05-21.md with details of the changes
- No README updates needed as these are implementation details
